As someone who loves spicy food, I eat my ramen with the level fire all the time. If you can handle really spicy food then fire will be nothing to you. I also love how flavorful and fresh their ramen is. Every time it comes out, it's always super hot and fresh, never lukewarm or anything like that. 

Service is also very nice. The place can get busy but even then, the servers try their best to check up on you, refill your water, etc.

The only problem with this place is that you can not substitute what you take out from your ramen for more of something else. You can only add extra which will cost about an extra $2 for each topping. I don't like bean sprouts or ground beef in my ramen so I always sub it for an egg and more chashu since you only get one piece. My bowl ends up being around $14. 

However, since their ramen is so delicious and their wait time is never over 15 min or so, I will always come back to this place.

It is a very small place and the service was VERY laid back. It took a while for the server to acknowledge that we were there, and even longer for our order to be taken. The server was very nice, but a little absent. The restaurant could definitely benefit from hiring a more experienced waitstaff...
That, however, was the only fault of Jaipur Junction. So if you are not in a hurry and want some of the most fantastic Indian food around, I highly recommend this place. We started off our meal with some chicken samosas and masala tea, both of which arrived very quickly! The samosas were delicious: fresh, nicely spiced, and crispy, just the way they should be. The tea was also very tasty. If you like chai, you will like this tamed down version.
For our entree I had the chicken tikka masala while my boyfriend ordered the chicken Patiala. The rice that came with the dishes was a little coconut-ty which was exquisite and our chicken dishes were both so much better than any other Indian food we had ever had. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection. 
After that, we were very full but had to try the dessert. Indian desserts are always a little strange but we decided to go for the kheer (rice pudding) and they also gave us a free bowl of gulab jamun. Both were quite good! The kheer has some nuts and fruit in it which were a nice surprise and the gulab jamun were soft and sweet. 
The entire meal took about an hour and half and cost under $40 which is not so bad considering we had 3 courses! So sure, the service could use an upgrade but it certainly is not going to deter me from going back. It was that good.


**Edit: Since this review, I have returned to Jaipur Junction several times. I am pleased to say that they have in fact hired more professional waitstaff. Now, you have no reason not to visit this place. Top Indian food in the area!**

I hadn't been able to try Kaba Curry at any of the food festivals it had been at, so I had been waiting in great anticipation for opening day of their (difficult to find) B&M location. I have to give these 3 budding entrepreneurs a lot of credit for trying, and truth be told, I really really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I am a Japanese curry snob, and just like so many of its brethren in town, Kaba doesn't make the grade. Its curry is way too watery and the spices far too subdued. It's also a bit too sweet for my taste. The chicken katsu is too small for charging $7. At a comparable counter-style curry joint in LA, you can get a heaping plate of curry rice with a chicken katsu at least 3 times as large and a side salad all for less than $6. It was also odd that it took 20 minutes to get my order. Shouldn't the curry and rice be all ready to go and the katsu take a few minutes to deep fry? I don't understand what took so long. It's not like they were busy.

At any rate, it's nothing personal guys. I wish you the best of luck, but I've got to tell it how it is. In my mind, if you want the best Japanese curry (that I've tasted so far), you've got to schlepp it all the way to Curry House in LA.

1. The doors were held open by two waitresses.
2. We were greeted with smiles from both of them welcoming us and we were also greeted with a smile and a welcome by the hostess. 
3. Expecting a wait I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately. 
4. We were immediately greeted by our waitress with a smile and a welcome. She was prompt, helpful, and you could just tell that she was there to make our experience a great one! 
5. Our friends got some cheese fries which looked awesome but I couldn't eat them because of my diet (low carb). I was laughing when I pointed out that they just HAD to put bacon on those fries. The waitress smiled and left and came back with a bowl of bacon ON THE HOUSE for yours truly!
6. When my steak came out it was cooked to perfection. 
7. My drink glass was never empty the entire time. 
8. I was asked if I wanted a box for what I couldn't eat. 
9. Oh and the manager came by to check on us with a smile. She also asked if we needed anything and when my buddy said he would like some more iced tea instead of sending the waitress back to do that she got it herself! 
10. When we left we were again thanked for coming and the doors held open for us BY THE MANAGER! 

I have to say that I have never received this high level of service from any restaurant anywhere.

The moment I walked through the door the guy who helped me last time, Gabriel, remembered my name off the bat.  This was unexpected and definitely went a long way with me.  I also noticed that there was someone spending much more money than me and he treated me just as well as them.  This is such a rarity in most industries, especially when there is such a disparity between people and the amount of money they spend.  He helped me (a humble teacher looking to get my foot in the door and who has virtually zero fashion sense) find a great suit at a very affordable price for what I was getting.  For $565 I got a suit jacket and pants, belt, shoes, and necessary alterations to the suit.  The retail for said items was pushing $900 and I went into the store and showed him a coupon that entitled me to 40% off my purchase.  He stated that that coupon wasn't available for the suit that I wanted but that he had a coupon in the back that would give me the discount I was hoping to receive.  Odds are he didn't really have the coupon and just gave the discount to make sure I was happy, but while he may have initially lost potential money on the deal, he gained a loyal customer.  Going out of the way to make sure I was happy with the price really spoke volumes to his commitment to customer service, as did his patience in helping me pick a suit that would enable me to look my best for a job fair I needed the clothes for.  I was also impressed that he did not pressure me with any up sells and was upfront with the price for the items and adjustments I needed.  This place is top shelf and Gabriel is a big contributor to that status.  I hope they are paying him well because it will be their loss if they let him get snatched up by someone else.  As a previous reviewer said, ""he is too good for Champaign.""  He also encouraged me to keep him updated with how my job search goes.  I was duly impressed and will be returning WHEN I get a coveted teaching job to celebrate by upgrading my wardrobe.

My kids love being there, the kids classes are great and the coaching that the kids receive is outstanding. They offer classes for people of all skill levels and the members that are more advanced are always willing to help new members with technique and drills. The fact that you get to learn from the coaches that train the pro fighters and sometimes learn from the pros when they teach a class, tops it off. wether you want to attend classes to potentially compete or just to get into great shape, Power MMA is THE gym to join!  I don't use the weight area yet but I know what machines and free weights they have and they have everything you need to get your weight training done. In the first year of me training at Power MMA I lost a total of 62lbs with the help and support of everyone at the gym.

As a neighborhood brewery, they are as good as it gets. With bi-annual group bike rides for charity, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and an environment that invites and promotes the discovery and discussion of beer, East End Brewing is a fantastic destination for just about anyone who enjoys quality brews.

Most of the beer is available on tap and distributed on a per customer basis through refillable growlers. I like that this promotes a conscious reuse of materials and reduces the net resource impact of the brewery's activities. Several specialty brews are also available in 750ml bottles. Samples of all the beer are available upon request free-of-charge at the brewery and are highly advisable given the following:

All of their beer is live, qualifying as ""real ale,"" and provides pro-biotic benefits alongside great flavor. As a fermentation enthusiast, I appreciate that my local brewer risks an occasional lapse in quality control for a shot at greatness. This means that their beer will be slightly different every time I go due to the metabolic processes ongoing within. I feel this is a huge advantage over other area breweries that are more interested in producing a predictable and easily distributed beer. After all, why drink a local beer brewed to withstand shipment across the country when there are better beers shipped in to Pittsburgh from other places available at a comparable price? East End's products are uniquely fresh, competitively priced, and variable. This variability is exactly why you should try the beers on-tap before purchasing a growler as even the year-round brews are bound to differ batch to batch and evolve with age. As for the bottled beer, it is ""conditioned"" in the bottle (meaning naturally carbonated by ongoing fermentation) and thus a given bottle will taste different than one consumed on a different day. The gamble of live beer allows for a shot at the legendary, something many other local breweries don't even try out of fear of the occasional bad beer. East End gives it a go and succeeds 9 times out of 10.

Now that I have cleared up exactly why I think East End is the best brewery in Pittsburgh, here are my opinions about a few of the beers: The Monkey Boy (hefeweizen) is perhaps one of the greatest of this style brewed in America. It is impossible to get one this good, this fresh, unless you are in Belgium. A fresh bottle of imported Franziskaner comes close. Fat Gary (nut brown ale) is alright fresh but truly excels if you leave your growler un-opened in the fridge for several days. Somehow this always tastes thin from the tap but matures quickly in the growler.  Big Hop (IPA) is a standard, a great beer to have fresh, but is eclipsed by competitors in a crowded and popular American style. Black Strap Stout is quaff-able quality anytime of year and indicates that you should never pass on the brewery's darker seasonal beers in the colder months. There is a rotating selection of seasonal brews that you should ALWAYS try when you stop in for a refill.

The staff has been of great help in my own brewing endeavors by providing sound advice and encouragement. It is well worth your time to visit East End and try a few of their beers whether you are an accomplished beer aficionado or stepping outside of the mainstream for the first time. The hours are weird but the beer is literally one-of-a-kind.",1.0,"-_hMdRTQV5kAClUT5oygyg","['favorite', 'pittsburgh', 'craft', 'beer', 'breweries', 'reasons', 'establishment', 'close', 'heart', 'neighborhood', 'brewery', 'good', 'gets', 'bi', 'annual', 'group', 'bike', 'rides', 'charity', 'knowledgeable', 'friendly', 'staff', 'environment', 'invites', 'promotes', 'discovery', 'discussion', 'beer', 'east', 'end', 'brewing', 'fantastic', 'destination', 'enjoys', 'quality', 'brews', 'beer', 'available', 'tap', 'distributed', 'customer', 'basis', 'refillable', 'growlers', 'like', 'promotes', 'conscious', 'reuse', 'materials', 'reduces', 'net', 'resource', 'impact', 'brewery', 'activities', 'specialty', 'brews', 'available', 'ml', 'bottles', 'samples', 'beer', 'available', 'request', 'free', 'charge', 'brewery', 'highly', 'advisable', 'given', 'following', 'beer', 'live', 'qualifying', 'real', 'ale', 'provides', 'pro', 'biotic', 'benefits', 'alongside', 'great', 'flavor', 'fermentation', 'enthusiast', 'appreciate', 'local', 'brewer', 'risks', 'occasional', 'lapse', 'quality', 'control', 'shot', 'greatness', 'means', 'beer', 'slightly', 'different', 'time', 'metabolic', 'processes', 'ongoing', 'feel', 'huge', 'advantage', 'area', 'breweries', 'interested', 'producing', 'predictable', 'easily', 'distributed', 'beer', 'drink', 'local', 'beer', 'brewed', 'withstand', 'shipment', 'country', 'better', 'beers', 'shipped', 'pittsburgh', 'places', 'available', 'comparable', 'price', 'east', 'end', 'products', 'uniquely', 'fresh', 'competitively', 'priced', 'variable', 'variability', 'exactly', 'try', 'beers', 'tap', 'purchasing', 'growler', 'year', 'round', 'brews', 'bound', 'differ', 'batch', 'batch', 'evolve', 'age', 'bottled', 'beer', 'conditioned', 'bottle', 'meaning', 'naturally', 'carbonated', 'ongoing', 'fermentation', 'given', 'bottle', 'taste', 'different', 'consumed', 'different', 'day', 'gamble', 'live', 'beer', 'allows', 'shot', 'legendary', 'local', 'breweries', 'try', 'fear', 'occasional', 'bad', 'beer', 'east', 'end', 'gives', 'succeeds', 'times', 'cleared', 'exactly', 'think', 'east', 'end', 'best', 'brewery', 'pittsburgh', 'opinions', 'beers', 'monkey', 'boy', 'hefeweizen', 'greatest', 'style', 'brewed', 'america', 'impossible', 'good', 'fresh', 'belgium', 'fresh', 'bottle', 'imported', 'franziskaner', 'comes', 'close', 'fat', 'gary', 'nut', 'brown', 'ale', 'alright', 'fresh', 'truly', 'excels', 'leave', 'growler', 'opened', 'fridge', 'days', 'tastes', 'tap', 'matures', 'quickly', 'growler', 'big', 'hop', 'ipa', 'standard', 'great', 'beer', 'fresh', 'eclipsed', 'competitors', 'crowded', 'popular', 'american', 'style', 'black', 'strap', 'stout', 'quaff', 'able', 'quality', 'anytime', 'year', 'indicates', 'pass', 'brewery', 'darker', 'seasonal', 'beers', 'colder', 'months', 'rotating', 'selection', 'seasonal', 'brews', 'try', 'stop', 'refill', 'staff', 'great', 'help', 'brewing', 'endeavors', 'providing', 'sound', 'advice', 'encouragement', 'worth', 'time', 'visit', 'east', 'end', 'try', 'beers', 'accomplished', 'beer', 'aficionado', 'stepping', 'outside', 'mainstream', 'time', 'hours', 'weird', 'beer', 'literally', 'kind']","2013-08-09"

I know, you're probably thinking what am I doing at this bar THAT often. Well truth be told, I come here either at lunch or after work dinner and drinks with good friends on a weekday and the ""boozing"" as the kids say, is never #1 on my agenda when I'm here - hell, it's hardly #5 these days.

Food-wise:
Pesto Chicken sandwich is AMAZING! When it's not Tuesday or Thursday, this is the go-to to go to. Oh, what's that? What's the deal with Tuesday or Thursday? That's when they have their mac & cheese w/ ham (or bacon) special - an item which was added to the new menu but then removed and was SO painfully delicious that my friend and I convinced the owner to have it once in a while. And by convinced, I mean I jokingly threatened to burn down the building. It's seriously delicious (though technically not macaroni pasta but who the eff cares?)",2.0,"l3Fl49jHSY2bU2k1T8jrdw","['frequent', 'visitor', 'place', 've', 'seen', 'weekend', 'want', 'avoid', 'frat', 'boy', 'clientele', 'want', 'kick', 'friends', 'beer', 'case', 'amaretto', 'sours', 'place', 'makes', 'perfection', 'opinion', 'atmosphere', 'staff', 'great', 'regular', 'start', 'feeling', 'like', 'family', 'know', 'probably', 'thinking', 'bar', 'truth', 'told', 'come', 'lunch', 'work', 'dinner', 'drinks', 'good', 'friends', 'weekday', 'boozing', 'kids', 'agenda', 'hell', 'hardly', 'days', 'food', 'wise', 'pesto', 'chicken', 'sandwich', 'amazing', 'tuesday', 'thursday', 'oh', 'deal', 'tuesday', 'thursday', 'mac', 'cheese', 'ham', 'bacon', 'special', 'item', 'added', 'new', 'menu', 'removed', 'painfully', 'delicious', 'friend', 'convinced', 'owner', 'convinced', 'mean', 'jokingly', 'threatened', 'burn', 'building', 'seriously', 'delicious', 'technically', 'macaroni', 'pasta', 'eff', 'cares']","2009-04-10"

I have been here before.  The food is consistent.

I have some severe food issues, and eat gluten free and avoid certain starches.

The restaurant was happy to accommodate me, and make some adjustments so that I could have a normal meal.

While the restaurants offers ""Gluten Friendly"" options, it is important to note that any of the items that are fried will be in a fryer that also handles gluten containing products.

In the past, they have dipped the tortillas quickly in the deep fryer to loosen them up, so I don't have anything using tortillas.

Even if you don't intend for it to be a romantic brunch, it's hard to avoid it because of the restaurant's location! Then we set out to fill plates and plates of delicious food. There was a huge selection of cold and hot seafood dishes! I went to town on the oysters! The desserts were also delicious too!  We spent a good 2-3 hours here!

As for food, this was the worst meal I have ever eaten at ANY restaurant. 12 people from my work meet here for dinner last night. I was initially impressed by what I saw on the menu. I tried the Carne con Chili, which came with a salad or soup. They had Posole  which I typically love. It was a dark red broth, with almost no hominy and very little meat. I ate 3 bites hoping it would get better. The last bite I tried tasted like some foreign type of meat covered in crap. It was not just the worst Posole I have ever eaten, but the WORST ANYTHING I have ever eaten ANYPLACE! 

The Carne con chili I had was what they called ""Mexican Hot"". It had the same strange taste to the red sauce, and was not much better. It was again a dark red soupy sauce, that tasted like it had half a bottle of Worcestershire, and with about a cup of small bites of pork. 2 of the 3 biggest pieces were nothing but fat. 

There were only 3 out of 12 people said they like the food, and 2 said average. All the people who liked it were from NE. I travel the SW doing service, and am an AZ native.

Stayed here with wife, 17 yr old daughter and her friend.
The grounds are extremely well kept! The rooms are clean and very large, but just a tad dated.
It's a nice spot to stay if you want to be away from the full on mayhem of the strip, but still be within walking distance, it's not a 2 step stroll, but we cut into Ballys and walked thur enroute to the strip, this makes it very comfortable.
I can't say enough good things about Marilyn's cafe in the resort, huge menu, very good food, excellent prices, and probably the most professional and polite staff if experienced in any restaurant ever.
We didn't eat at the other two restaurants on the property but if Marilyn's is any indication I'm sure they are top notch.
Pool area is not overly big, but we had no issues getting lounges everyday, the pool staff is also attentive and professional.
Bottom line is that this place would be a bargain at 100.00 a night, but our stay averaged 50.00! (Some weekday, some weekend)

The bar/tasting room is beautiful. It's decorated well, it's a great space to hang out and it's very welcoming. The bartender was very nice, informative and friendly and we really enjoyed the ambiance. 

So here's why we didn't like the place: THE PRICING

We had 3 drinks and a tasting flight which had half shots of each one of their distilled spirits. This was during happy hour (which is very confusing since the board says ""signature drinks $4"" but doesn't include their actual signature drinks but just their ""signature spirits with a mixer of your choice). So how much should two drinks and a small tasting flight cost? $60.23?!? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WHAT AN EPIC RIP OFF. I almost had a stroke when I saw what we were being charged.

Based on everyone's feedback, Donnie seems to know what he was doing. I was a bit apprehensive at first as well. He does window tinting from home in his garage with a 20years of background according to him. After checking his work and available equipment, he seems legitimate so I agreed to get our cars tinted after offering a good price. 

The quality of his work seems reasonable so we left with a good peace of mind. We were satisfied. It was late that evening so we didn't get the other car done the same evening. Donnie suggested to leave the car with him and showed me with confidence that my car will be kept safe and nothing to worry. So I did and paid him in advance. Given the weather conditions, the car was left with him for 3days and took it to work as we have agreed so he can work on the car as it requires sunlight to remove the old film. I had trouble getting ahold of him but eventually, I got the car back 3days after. It was in the evening.

Upon retrieving the car, he damaged the back window. There was visible scratches. I was a bit upset but he was apologetic and offered solutions to remedy the situation. He either replace the window or offered to tint  the front windshield of the cars. I appreciate his honestly. To make things easier for him, I took his offer to tint the front windows in lieu of the damaged back window. He ask me to return in a couple of days so I agreed. As we get closer to the date, I had trouble getting ahold of him. He said, he was sick and had to leave town so we made other arrangements to return at later date. I texted him prior and we both agreed to bring the car Sunday afternoon. Sunday comes, his phone was unavailable all day and couldn't reach him. I left several text messages and voicemails and receive no response back. He did not bother returning my calls either. 

I feel Donnie is not true to his words and failed to provide resolution to my damaged window. To this date, I have not received a phone call from him and I am filing a complaint against him. I personally do not recommend this person to work on your car. The tint on the back window not only he damaged it, it was poorly done.

It's been almost 2 years since my female pittie boarded for 2 weeks with Rachel and Dan. Since then I have been attending their on-site, in park classes in Summerlin as well as their classes at the corporate office. Rachel, Dan(who my dog adores) and the entire Sit Means Sit staff have been nothing but educating,  supportive and knowledgable while my pittie and I both learned to change our habits. In the past, my dog was unable to be in the same room as a strange dog and now she sits there with her full attention on me, completely ok with the other dogs.   They have done a great job at catering the activities in classes to my pittbull and the other dogs' specific problem and creating situations which help them work through these problems. In the process, if your dog is the most problematic in class she/he will not be treated like a pariah. The Sit Means Sit staff and clients are very tolerant and understanding when it comes to problem behavior. New dogs come in weekly and with work improve and change so drastically that everyone knows its only a matter of time before that problem dog is changed too.  For this reason, the corporate and on location group classes give you plenty of opportunities for your dog to work on whatever issues it may have. It also can be useful as just plain teaching your dog some off leash commands. The collar is definitely not a shock collar and has been a vital tool in teaching my dog to pay attention. The trainers will work with you and help you tailor your training to what works for you. I wish I would have done this when I first adopted my pittie. When you sign up don't expect an instant miracle. If you have major issues such as aggression it will take work and persistence in class as well as out of class. It's been a learning experience for me and I'm preparing my dog to take the Good Canine Citizen test. Whatever your goals the trainers are here to assist you.

Whatever, I just wanted froyo for dinner. So I grab my container and check out my selections. First sadness because there wasn't many choices, no Cheesecake which is what I wanted. They did have Salted Caramel - sweet and salty? I'm in! So I got that one and thinking Vanilla would even it out I got some of that. The Salted Caramel was actually good, would've been better off just with that. The Vanilla was wayyy to sweet, almost overpowering.

They had a TON of topping choices, which was exciting...until I realized, nothing really good goes with Salted Caramel. I should've checked out the toppings first, they had kiwi, blueberries, and other fruit options I would've immediatly went for. They also had a lot of chocolate offers, white chocolate chips, candy bars, etc. But since I had the odd Salted Caramel, I went with waffle pieces and gramhn cracker crumble. Pretty good.

Next visit, I'll grab the sample cups that I noticed at the cashier area, AFTER I already got my froyo, and try out the other choices before I go with any one.

Firstly, the (weight) equipment is made for men! I could barely reach when I sat in most of them (I'm only 5'2""), which doesn't make for a very effective workout. When I was on the pec machine my arms were hyper-extended too far especially for the weight that was on it.  I'm ok with using free weights as well but if I'm going to pay for a gym membership it would be nice to fully utilize it.

Secondly, the group classes (at least the ones I thought I might want to try) were all at inconvenient times. Needless to say, I didn't attend any of them.

The worst part for me was booking two personal training sessions. My ""trainer"" Rhys, first asked me what my goals were and what I most wanted to work on. I was expecting to get some different ideas for workouts. First session he just tested my ability and fitness level and he decided I was ""athletic"".  When he was checking my form at one point he kept trying to correct me and said I was holding the bar uneven. Well no kidding...duh....I had already told him earlier I had a bad shoulder. It just so happened another trainer was watching and he asked if I had an injury on that shoulder. Funny how he knew that without even speaking with me before and my so-called trainer who I had told before, ""forgot"". 

Anyway, the next day he was still 'testing' me. Near the end of the 2nd session he had me doing this exercise jumping sideways up and over this bench-type thing which I told him was too high for me but he said no it's fine so I tried doing it. Not until I fell is when he says, ""ok, maybe you need the shorter one."" Umm...ya think? 

One exercise in particular during the 2nd session is why I will NEVER go back to World Health and advise everyone I know not to either....Rhys had me bench pressing weights that he knew were too heavy for me. (He told me this before I did it.) He said the purpose was to prove to myself that I could finish a set, not to give up even though it was difficult. He said if I couldn't get the weight up he would help me lift it, but I was to get to 10 no matter what. I did it but I really don't think he helped me at all. I kept pushing through it because I didn't want the weights to fall on me. Of course I was pushing harder (unevenly) with what used to be my better and stronger arm/shoulder. Well, a year later I'm still paying for it. When I first hurt my ""good"" shoulder (rotator cuff) I just thought it would get better on it's own. I didn't want to completely baby it so I still went to the gym (on my own) after that, but at the same time still going easier on it. Eight months later and it still wasn't better and started to hurt more. Needless to say, I am now going to physio for a tear in my rotator cuff. Did I mention how much the mofo hurts??!! I'm sure the hyper-extension on the too-big pec machine earlier didn't help either.

I'm all for lifting heavy weights but not to the point where it affects your form thereby injuring yourself. If I did it working out by myself, then that's one thing but this was with a trainer who you trust that they know what they're doing and are supposed to help you, making sure you DON'T get injured.

I honestly don't know how qualified some of the trainers are there. I guess it is partly my fault for not doing more research and asking what his qualifications were. They should have a degree in kinesiology at the very least, not a two-weekend 'trainer' course.

I've been to the Bay club location before and that was better than this one but still only a mediocre experience.

This place is just a money grab!!  Oh, did I mention I won't be going back to any World Health locations...EVER! 

Btw, I rarely write reviews but this was such a bad experience that I wanted to warn other people about this place and to be cautious about it. Reading reviews before proceeding with other things has helped me make decisions about whether or not to use a service or not. Hope this helps prevent someone else from getting hurt.

Beautiful decor, love the contemporary feel with the chalk blackboard  wall. Great location, the Camelback Inn is very beautiful.  The meal began with the chef's gift of  warm chicken liver spread with thyme and crusty bread - wonderfu,l followed by  the gruyere glazed popover served with a ramekin of european butter and sea salt.-amazing!  A little recipe card is included with the popovers-nice touch.   I wish I had more positives to say I really wanted to love this restaurant.

So now for the reasons for the 2 star rating.   
When we arrived for our reservation, it would have been nice to have heard happy anniversary since we had noted that on our open table reservation.We were  seated in a great round booth nice intimate location for our anniversary dinner. When we arrived at our booth she  pulled the table out so we could snuggle in the back and on the seat was food.  Thankfully she noticed and I thought she would apologize and promptly clean up. What happened next should have been a warning sign of how our night was going to turn out.  She said, ""Oh"" and stood there, so I said ""here I'll move so you can clean that off.  She then proceeded to enter the booth and swipe the food off the seat onto the floor with her hand.  Not what I'd expect of a Laurent Tourondel restaurant. Our server arrived  promptly but still no happy anniversary.  I don't mean to make a big deal out of the lack of a greeting, it's just  a nice touch when celebrating a special occasion, definitely not a reason to give a 2 star rating though , so I'll continue.   We ordered our wine and to our surprise our server returned promptly and to our relief wished us Happy Anniversary, which quickly turned awkward as he tried to connect with us and tell us all of his friends are starting to marry and have children and now his girlfriend is looking at him wondering what his problem is that he hasn't asked her to marry him yet and how wow thats a lot of responsibility and he didn't know how people could get married blah blah blah. Thanks, you could've kept your happy anniversary.  Awkward and uncomfortable!  He then proceeded to tell us that the wine we ordered was not chilled enough and would we mind if he chilled it for 6-10 minutes.  Really, how could the wine not be chilled if it's on the menu.  Still ok at this point, we aren't high maintenace diners and honestly pretty easy going and very forgiving.  We thought at this point he would take our orders, however even though we were only 1 or 3 tables filled in the restaurant he did not return to take our order until our wine was chilled.  What he did do was help the table next to ours get that perfect photo for their memory album and blind us with the flash of their camera several times cause they weren't quite happy with their photo.  To his credit he did apologize when he returned to take our order.  

I ordered the spice rubbed cowboy ribeye, my husband the bone in rib eye, a side of the creamed spinach, jalapeno mash, and hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of chimichuri and green peppercorn sauce.   The cowboy ribeye comes to the table with the whole rib attached to the ribeye not expecting that. The spices were so charred the only flavor I got was burnt and the meat itself was so fatty half the steak was totally inedible. My husband kindly shared his steak which was good, but hardly anything I would return for.  Great hen of the woods mushrooms really enjoyed these  favorite part of the dinner.  The rest of the sides ok nothing great though.  
We finished and my husband had to refill his own wine glass, because our server was chatting and taking pictures again. 

 What happened next was truly shocking, something I'd expect if we were at Mcdonalds  but not a upscale steakhouse.  An electrician showed up and proceeded to change the light bulb that was out at the booth next to ours.  Mind you by this time it was 10:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 11pm.  Really are you freaking kidding me you can't wait a half hour to change a light bulb.  

To BLT'S credit they arrived  with a complimentary dessert, however as the wait staff, not our server sets it down in front of us and promptly walks away without explaining what it was we looked down and in fittingly comic horror scribbled on the plate is Happy Birthday!  WOW!!
Our server shows to drop off the check and looks at the plate and says"" did they write happy birthday?  haha that's funny""

Really BLT!  We trusted the reputation of Laurent Tourondel to schedule our special occasion and this was very amateur and embarrassing for your restaurant  at best.  When you go out to dinner and willing fork out over $200 for a meal this is not what is expected.  
I guess my husband and I should thank BLT for giving us such a  great story to tell all of our friends and family of the night we wasted over $200 on a comical night of amateur proportion.",4.0,"xodxHGXraLyVZYSx05ss_g","['decided', 'eat', 'th', 'anniversary', 'dinner', 'let', 'start', 'positives', 'beautiful', 'decor', 'love', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'chalk', 'blackboard', 'wall', 'great', 'location', 'camelback', 'inn', 'beautiful', 'meal', 'began', 'chef', 'gift', 'warm', 'chicken', 'liver', 'spread', 'thyme', 'crusty', 'bread', 'wonderfu', 'followed', 'gruyere', 'glazed', 'popover', 'served', 'ramekin', 'european', 'butter', 'sea', 'salt', 'amazing', 'little', 'recipe', 'card', 'included', 'popovers', 'nice', 'touch', 'wish', 'positives', 'wanted', 'love', 'restaurant', 'reasons', 'star', 'rating', 'arrived', 'reservation', 'nice', 'heard', 'happy', 'anniversary', 'noted', 'open', 'table', 'reservation', 'seated', 'great', 'round', 'booth', 'nice', 'intimate', 'location', 'anniversary', 'dinner', 'arrived', 'booth', 'pulled', 'table', 'snuggle', 'seat', 'food', 'thankfully', 'noticed', 'thought', 'apologize', 'promptly', 'clean', 'happened', 'warning', 'sign', 'night', 'going', 'turn', 'said', 'oh', 'stood', 'said', 'll', 'clean', 'proceeded', 'enter', 'booth', 'swipe', 'food', 'seat', 'floor', 'hand', 'expect', 'laurent', 'tourondel', 'restaurant', 'server', 'arrived', 'promptly', 'happy', 'anniversary', 'mean', 'big', 'deal', 'lack', 'greeting', 'nice', 'touch', 'celebrating', 'special', 'occasion', 'definitely', 'reason', 'star', 'rating', 'll', 'continue', 'ordered', 'wine', 'surprise', 'server', 'returned', 'promptly', 'relief', 'wished', 'happy', 'anniversary', 'quickly', 'turned', 'awkward', 'tried', 'connect', 'tell', 'friends', 'starting', 'marry', 'children', 'girlfriend', 'looking', 'wondering', 'problem', 'hasn', 'asked', 'marry', 'wow', 'thats', 'lot', 'responsibility', 'know', 'people', 'married', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'thanks', 've', 'kept', 'happy', 'anniversary', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'proceeded', 'tell', 'wine', 'ordered', 'chilled', 'mind', 'chilled', 'minutes', 'wine', 'chilled', 'menu', 'ok', 'point', 'aren', 'high', 'maintenace', 'diners', 'honestly', 'pretty', 'easy', 'going', 'forgiving', 'thought', 'point', 'orders', 'tables', 'filled', 'restaurant', 'return', 'order', 'wine', 'chilled', 'help', 'table', 'perfect', 'photo', 'memory', 'album', 'blind', 'flash', 'camera', 'times', 'cause', 'weren', 'happy', 'photo', 'credit', 'apologize', 'returned', 'order', 'ordered', 'spice', 'rubbed', 'cowboy', 'ribeye', 'husband', 'bone', 'rib', 'eye', 'creamed', 'spinach', 'jalapeno', 'mash', 'hen', 'woods', 'mushrooms', 'chimichuri', 'green', 'peppercorn', 'sauce', 'cowboy', 'ribeye', 'comes', 'table', 'rib', 'attached', 'ribeye', 'expecting', 'spices', 'charred', 'flavor', 'got', 'burnt', 'meat', 'fatty', 'half', 'steak', 'totally', 'inedible', 'husband', 'kindly', 'shared', 'steak', 'good', 'hardly', 'return', 'great', 'hen', 'woods', 'mushrooms', 'enjoyed', 'favorite', 'dinner', 'rest', 'sides', 'ok', 'great', 'finished', 'husband', 'refill', 'wine', 'glass', 'server', 'chatting', 'taking', 'pictures', 'happened', 'truly', 'shocking', 'expect', 'mcdonalds', 'upscale', 'steakhouse', 'electrician', 'showed', 'proceeded', 'change', 'light', 'bulb', 'booth', 'mind', 'time', 'pm', 'restaurant', 'closed', 'pm', 'freaking', 'kidding', 'wait', 'half', 'hour', 'change', 'light', 'bulb', 'blt', 'credit', 'arrived', 'complimentary', 'dessert', 'wait', 'staff', 'server', 'sets', 'promptly', 'walks', 'away', 'explaining', 'looked', 'fittingly', 'comic', 'horror', 'scribbled', 'plate', 'happy', 'birthday', 'wow', 'server', 'shows', 'drop', 'check', 'looks', 'plate', 'says', 'write', 'happy', 'birthday', 'haha', 'funny', 'blt', 'trusted', 'reputation', 'laurent', 'tourondel', 'schedule', 'special', 'occasion', 'amateur', 'embarrassing', 'restaurant', 'best', 'dinner', 'willing', 'fork', 'meal', 'expected', 'guess', 'husband', 'thank', 'blt', 'giving', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'friends', 'family', 'night', 'wasted', 'comical', 'night', 'amateur', 'proportion']","2010-07-18"

THE GOOD

1. Fresh and tasty. The food comes quickly, but is always prepared fresh. Your best bets are to go either very early at opening, or during the meal rushes for the freshest batches.

2. Cheap. The price is quite good, especially since traditional Japanese restaurants are quite pricey.

THE BAD

1. Hard to find for the FIRST time. Once you know how to get there, it's pretty convenient.

Although my wallet was sad afterwards, I do not regret eating the delicious 14 oz NY Strip steak and truffle mac and cheese, unnffff. 

The exterior of the place makes it look like some shady strip club or something because there were no windows just some doors. When we walked in I felt like I was in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland cuz it was so dark. Nonetheless, never judge a book by it's cover! The atmosphere was great and the waiters and waitresses were extra friendly. 

As for the quality of food, I'd say it has been spot on. The first time I went here was last year when I was craving Linguine and clams at 2AM and thankfully this place was open (you have no idea how much I love linguine and clams). It was a to-go order and service was fast. The linguine and clams wasn't the best I ever had, but! Being hormonal at 2AM, it was pretty damn good. & they used real clams, not that salty canned crap.

My most recent visit on the 08-24-15 was even better because I had a chance to actually sit down and enjoy everything right there. We started off with some appetizers of Spicy Mussels. It was a good amount of mussels drenched in marinara/tomato sauce and came with 2 loafs of bread. It was a comfortable level of spice and the fact that it was 1/2 off made it more merrier. 

I ordered the 14 oz NY Strip Steak medium rare and it included my choice of one side so of course when I see something like Truffle Mac n Cheese, hell freaking yeah I'm choosing that! Again, service was pretty quick. My steak was cooked perfectly. It was literally the most beautiful thing I had seen in days haha. I was a little disappointed in the Truffle Mac n Cheese though. It was good but not great :/ I felt like it wasn't cheesey enough or something. Idk it just needed a little extra something! It's my fault, I hyped myself up for Mac n Cheese all day that day. 

Overall I've had a great experience here. Waiters were on top of their water-refill game. I'd take like a small sip and it's like their water-refill senses shit was tingling or something cuz 5 seconds later they'd be over my shoulder refilling my cup haha.

On March 31st, we purchased our couch. Our experience at the store was easy and our sales person seemed knowledgeable. We found a sectional that we liked and were able to customize it for ONLY a $100 more.  Our sales person told us that we would have the couch within 4-6 weeks. 

After about 3 weeks I called the store to ask for the status of our couch. This is when all the problems started. The store was unable to find our purchase. After a few hours of searching they were able to locate our order. They had the order under the wrong name and the contact phone number was transposed. That is when I started asking questions. They informed me that it was their error and they would update our information. At that same time I was told that our couch would be in their store the week of June 22nd.

The following week I then called to check the status again. This was my first contact with Ricky (the store manager). He told me that it was his first day at that location and to please go easy on him. I simply asked for an update on our couch. That is when he told me that I was given the wrong information about when the couch was to arrive. He told me that my couch was not even going into production until July 8th. I asked if there was a way to expedite the order? I was told no.

On July 8th, I contacted Ricky to get an update and he told me that the couch was in production and it would be on a truck by the end of the week. 

I then called Tim in their customer service department to ask if there was anything they could do to expedite our order so we could get the couch in the time they had promised. He informed me that he was unable to do anything but provided me with the regional managers contact information.

I contacted Mike Norris with their corporate headquarters and left a message on July 14th to discuss the situation with my couch. That same day I also contacted the store to find out the status of my couch and was told by Ricky that the couch was on a truck and was on its way to the store. I asked Ricky where the couch was coming from so I could get an approximate date of arrival. Ricky told me that the couch was coming from CA and he wasn't sure where. Another lie. 

With trying to reach Mike Norris I was having zero luck. I then contacted Tim in customer service again on July 15th to find out if he could provide me with more information. That is when he informed me that my couch was NOT on a truck and they were hoping to get it on the following day! Another lie!

On July 16th, I was finally able to reach Mike Norris and I told him of the entire situation. He apologized to me and told me that my couch was on a truck and he would further investigate all of the issues. I NEVER heard back from him. I have left several messages since. 

On July 18th, Ricky contacted me at 10:30 AM and asked if I would like the couch on a same day delivery... I said ABSOLUTELY! He told me that the couch would be on the truck that was departing at 4:00 PM and that the driver would call one hour in advance. I was so excited. They were finally going to do something right. 

At 8:00 PM I had not heard from the delivery truck drivers so I contacted the store. That is when I was told my couch was NOT on the truck. The store manager at that time again apologized and said she would have Ricky call me first thing in the morning.

The following morning I did not receive a call, but my other half did. The store had left a message telling us that our couch was not going to be delivered until we paid the final balance. We were pissed. Why had no one told us that prior? They had 6 1/2 weeks to get it. We were also told by our sales person on day of purchase that we did not have to pay in full and could pay the remainder of the balance at delivery! Another lie. 

I contacted Ricky and was infuriated! After many choice words with him, we were told that because we had chose to customize/special order for our couch we would not receive a refund. We ended up paying the remaining balance and was told again the couch would be there after 4:00 PM with an hour call ahead. 

At about 1:30 PM we received a call that our couch was 20-30 mins out. The delivery driver came to our home and dropped off our couch. Out of curiosity we asked if he had just picked up the couch. Turns out our couch was on the morning delivery truck the entire time. Another lie!

From this experience, I will NEVER purchase thru the room store AGAIN and would highly suggest no one else do the same. If you are looking for a headache free company do not buy through them. Also, if you are looking for a company that won't feed you lies, do not go to them!

We were also staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, but that actually gets you no discount or voucher, or actually anything towards Rehab... Sooo.. WE LOVED REHAB! And definitely think if you are visiting Vegas and like to have a good time - you NEED to go here at least once! I hadn't had any friends who previously went to Rehab, so I was left to figure out everything on my own and figured I would share...

Visiting Rehab for the first time... What you need to know/ what I learned:
1) Get on a guest list! - We used NoCoverNightClubs.com and between two guys and one girl - I got in for free and each guy had to pay $40. (PS - They didn't tell us that before arriving... We found out guys had to pay upon arrival)
2) Arrive early. (Before noon). Even if you aren't on a guest list - the place will fill up and you have no where to put your towel/ belongings.
3) Security is rough here. I have never been so felt up before or patted down. They check every single crease and crack in your bag, wallet, cigarettes, etc. So don't try to be sneaky!
4) The pool has a few different parts to it - one part is the SPLASHING and wild part. One part is the ""The water is shallow enough to stand, lets drink part,"" and the last part is the ""The water is too deep to stand, so I will sit on the edge and dance and drink just fine here."" Luckily, we got the sit part so we had a place to store towels & drinks.
5) Bring as little as possible with you. They do not allow large bags or any sort of food/ beverages.
6) DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE! And I mean EXPENSIVE! $30 a drink. So if you want to order a drink for you and your friend, its $60. Crazy! The drinks are large, don't get me wrong - but they aren't that strong and you will probably end up drinking at least three if you arrive early to get a good buzz going. They also have shot girls which are cash only - I think $6 each - try and get some of those in!
7) The main DJ won't go on until 4 or so.. I lost track of time... But it was late. And Rehab was open until about 7, or so. (I think....)

The menu is all vegan and personalized by the chef of each location. They do a great job with their dishes, everything is light and the core ingredients really shine through.

Our spring rolls were crunchy and full of fresh veggies, the peanut sauce was light and balanced its sweet and savoriness perfectly.

It's an odd location, I feel it would be better suited closer to the city but I hope it works for them.

When we arrived, parking in the garage had me a little concerned, I didn't see a security presence at all and it seemed a bit sketchy, but ultimately my car was fine when we left. The the staff wasn't super friendly during check in (not surprising during labor day weekend) and much of the clientele looked shady, but the room was great! Very large room, very very very comfortable bed, I wanted to take that bed home with me. I was really impressed by the room, the decor was nice - may be left overs from the Hilton days? My only complaint is the room smelled a little musty, almost like it used to be a smoking room but it wasn't that bad that it overshadowed or was uncomfortable. 

I also loved the access to the monorail, it was super convenient since the hotel is on the northeast side of the Strip, it made getting to the other hotels so much cheaper and faster than taking cabs.

It is housed in one of the most beautiful industrial era buildings in the entire city, situated next to the Yahara River's train trestle bike bridge, and has ample parking nearby. 

The interior is equally beautiful, evoking the Art Deco era without hewing strictly to it. They have one TV now that is rarely on, but the staff are wonderful and will put on the Packer game each week or a big Badger hoops game if you ask (otherwise, we often see Noirish films from the era previously mentioned). Secondary rooms beyond the bar are beautifully rendered, sometimes making me feel like I'm in an even earlier era, around the late 1800s or early 1900s. The food is astonishingly good, and the tap beer, scotch and overall quality of alcohol servings is among the best in town. 

The even bigger draw is the music. Not only do they have the best jukebox in town--it rivals that of Genna's or the Plaza's in the early 80s--they provide live music of all different stripes many nights per week in the bar. The best part is that I don't ever recall there being a cover charge for incredible punk rock shows featuring 3-4 bands (some open mic nights and local bands occasionally pass a bucket if memory serves, though I am rarely at those types of shows). I've also seen the vast majority of Madison's eclectic tribute bands at Mickey's, giving it an even more special place in my heart.

I am only making this review because I don't want them to slack on their customer service. I brought my son swimming here for the first time because he does not know how to swim. There was a male lifeguard in place who was very vigilant of everyone in the pool. He then switched out with a female. She was doing a great job until a customer came in and started distracting her by holding what appears to be juicy unnecessary girl talk. I watched as the lifeguard kept trying to hold the conversation looking eye to eye with the person and many times away from my son. Without exaggeration this conversation went on for about 13-15 minutes while my son was swimming. I think I am being nice because it seemed longer. I then broke my silence and yelled across the pool and said  to the lifeguard ""Helloooo...that is a gossip session....this here (pointing to the pool) is a life and death situation"".

The positive: I give this lifeguard a 1000% credit for getting out of bed on a Christmas Eve going to work to do that job. You have to have a big heart to be a lifeguard. I also thank her for not getting an attitude. She seemed like she understood where I was coming from. Furthermore, I sensed that the person she was chatting with was someone she knew and did not want to hurt their feelings. It seemed she just couldn't bring herself to say ""'Hey, no offense but can we chat later?"".

To the lifeguard, from me to you, let nothing and no one distract you. Have the guts to tell those who want to ""chit chat"" ""I can't chat right now, I am performing my lifeguard duties"". 

Sincerely, 

Kim. C

I've been to the lounge for a few events that had passed apps but decided to get the pre-fixe meal for our dinner date here.

APPETIZERS: Edamame, miso soup, and shishito peppers. Standard dishes, nothing unusual. The shishito peppers were better than expected, but could have used more of the sweet soy sauce.
SIGNATURE PLATES: The Hamachi Fusion was the same as the hamachi carpaccio with jalapeno dish that is popular elsewhere. The signature Koi Crispy Rice is a favorite of mine, but BF found the rice to be dense and gummy. I was disappointed that there were only two pieces in the order. The Creamy Shrimp Tempura was a surprise, lightly fried and lightly sauced instead of covered in mayo as I had feared. Light flavor, large portion.
SIGNATURE ROLLS: Baked Crab Roll could also be called the basic crab roll but at least it was fresh. The Geleno roll (spicy tuna, spicy albacore, jalapeno, crispy onion, spinach chips) sounded like it would be nicely spicy but it was pretty tame, and lacked the texture I had anticipated from the onion and spinach. The Sunfire Roll (lobster, snow crab, cucumber, cilantro, mango, avocado) was light and refreshing but could have used a sauce to pump it up a bit more. 
We also added on the salmon carpaccio dish with black truffles and citrus- it was probably the best dish of the night despite the heavy-handed use of truffle oil. The sashimi was nicely fatty but very thinly cut, the microgreens added texture, but the dish overall needed more citrus and less oil. 
DESSERT: The Koi Cheesecake was very cheesy, as in not sweet as a dessert is typically expected. The white chocolate walls, whipped cream, and fruit used in the plating were necessary to make the cake itself palatable. 

Overall, we were let down by the food. The atmosphere is nice and staff were attentive and polite, but the dishes just didn't impress. While their fish quality may be high, I didn't notice enough of an upgrade to compensate for the lack of flavor- I've had more interesting rolls at off-Strip AYCE spots.The signature dishes were okay, we just expected better.",14.0,"bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw","['ve', 'heard', 'koi', 'years', 'recently', 'meal', 've', 'lounge', 'events', 'passed', 'apps', 'decided', 'pre', 'fixe', 'meal', 'dinner', 'date', 'appetizers', 'edamame', 'miso', 'soup', 'shishito', 'peppers', 'standard', 'dishes', 'unusual', 'shishito', 'peppers', 'better', 'expected', 'sweet', 'soy', 'sauce', 'signature', 'plates', 'hamachi', 'fusion', 'hamachi', 'carpaccio', 'jalapeno', 'dish', 'popular', 'signature', 'koi', 'crispy', 'rice', 'favorite', 'bf', 'rice', 'dense', 'gummy', 'disappointed', 'pieces', 'order', 'creamy', 'shrimp', 'tempura', 'surprise', 'lightly', 'fried', 'lightly', 'sauced', 'instead', 'covered', 'mayo', 'feared', 'light', 'flavor', 'large', 'portion', 'signature', 'rolls', 'baked', 'crab', 'roll', 'called', 'basic', 'crab', 'roll', 'fresh', 'geleno', 'roll', 'spicy', 'tuna', 'spicy', 'albacore', 'jalapeno', 'crispy', 'onion', 'spinach', 'chips', 'sounded', 'like', 'nicely', 'spicy', 'pretty', 'tame', 'lacked', 'texture', 'anticipated', 'onion', 'spinach', 'sunfire', 'roll', 'lobster', 'snow', 'crab', 'cucumber', 'cilantro', 'mango', 'avocado', 'light', 'refreshing', 'sauce', 'pump', 'bit', 'added', 'salmon', 'carpaccio', 'dish', 'black', 'truffles', 'citrus', 'probably', 'best', 'dish', 'night', 'despite', 'heavy', 'handed', 'use', 'truffle', 'oil', 'sashimi', 'nicely', 'fatty', 'thinly', 'cut', 'microgreens', 'added', 'texture', 'dish', 'overall', 'needed', 'citrus', 'oil', 'dessert', 'koi', 'cheesecake', 'cheesy', 'sweet', 'dessert', 'typically', 'expected', 'white', 'chocolate', 'walls', 'whipped', 'cream', 'fruit', 'plating', 'necessary', 'cake', 'palatable', 'overall', 'let', 'food', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'staff', 'attentive', 'polite', 'dishes', 'impress', 'fish', 'quality', 'high', 'notice', 'upgrade', 'compensate', 'lack', 'flavor', 've', 'interesting', 'rolls', 'strip', 'ayce', 'spots', 'signature', 'dishes', 'okay', 'expected', 'better']","2016-09-06"

The inclinator in the pyramid is interesting the first time then it is just an elevator after that.  The rooms are smaller in the pyramid.  Love the bathrooms, separate, all glass shower, from the deep soaking tub with built in arm rests.  The soaps and scents are from the spa and smell so yummy.   Got some great rates in the past $60-80 a night online with some coupons for the spa, dining and IMAX show.  
Love the decor of being in Egypt.
King Tut museum wasn't impressive, but free.
I remember when they did the barge tour inside the pyramid and that 
was weak too.  They closed that one.
IMAX ride, In Search of the Obelisk was weak too, there are other movies. $12.  Like to location of being near Mandalay Bay and the tram to it.

Pool is nice, four of them.  One has these huge huge columns with 
water spewing from them.  I seem to go when at least one pool is 
under construction.

Came here for the long running Blue Men Group, saw it a few times, it 
was that good, what they do with twinkies and marshmallows is too 
hilarious, let alone pvc piping and neon paint.  You don't want to 
sit in the first 6 rows, let me just say, those seats come with rain

I did not have a good time at all.  Not because of the crowd, not because of the music or the ambiance or the price of the drinks.  All of that is negligible with enough pre-game liquor.  But no, to me, this place sucked all because of the STAIRS.

Yes, the STAIRS.

First of all, to even get to the club, you have to go up maybe 4 flights of escalators to make it to the club entrance.  Alright, no big deal.

Then, you'll have to wait in line.  If you're on the ladies' guestlist, it's maybe a 10-15 minute wait.  No problem.  

Finally get your ID checked and your wrist stamped, and then you're led into this stark white corridor featuring what looks like a torturous flight to heaven.  Yes, stairs, stairs, and stairs.  And more stairs.  These are fire escape stairs too, so imagine the clack, clack, clack.  After the FOURTH flight, I started to get a little belligerent in my 5"" heels.  But we finally got there.

First floor.  Hip hop.  Douchey, sweaty people.

MORE STAIRS

Second floor.  House music. The elevators were blocked off by a burly man who wouldn't let anyone use it.  I'm surprised I didn't kick him in the nuts.  Oh yeah.  It's probably because my feet were aching from the treacherous hike in 5"" heels.  Outdoor pool area was pretty cool.  Okay, it was pretty breathtaking.  But, still:

MORE STAIRS

Third floor.  Harry Potter-type library setting where the cocktail waitresses dressed like slutty library nerds.  It was quite awesome if you ask me.  This was worth upping this review by 1 star.

Time to exit the club.  Guess what?  

MORE STAIRS (?!)

We had to climb UP more stairs only to go DOWN the stairs to the exit.  Was I being punked here?!

I realize that maybe the stair scenario isn't the case every night.  But as a lady who's used to being treated like royalty in this city - never again (okay, unless we can actually use the elevators).

It is ultra smooth, not too hoppy for my liking, while still holding a great flavor. 

The one downside is the lack of TVs for anyone looking to go and watch a sporting event. I went last night to watch a game and to my dismay I forgot there are only two TVs up at the bar. The other two, even larger TVs, are reserved for a scenic slideshow. When asked if those could be changed, I was told they are just for the slideshow.

SHAME on you Slyman's for intentionally making it hard on your handicapped diners.  2) The counter high tables and stools are unrealistically tall.  Anyone less than 6 ft tall has to sit with their feet tangling...like a kid.  That is NOT comfortable.  3)The food - ugg. Our food was like that of a chain restaurant that doesn't know what they are doing - Not an award winning restaurant.  The sandwiches were cold.  the corn beef was dry. The pastrami was burnt and in shreds. The onion rings were average, at best.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product.

The giant sculpture in the center kind of made me feel glutinous and I actually did not order an appetizer or dessert because it made me feel bad.

The owner came to our home, helped us talk through our design, and drew out a diagram of our granite to ensure that the fabricators cut our slab in a way that captured the movement in the piece we chose. He even offered for us to be able to speak to the fabricators personally in the warehouse if we wanted but said ""I'll take care of it"" since I was busy - and they sure delivered!

 We actually chose 2 different varieties of granite (1 for the island and 1 for the perimeter) and their installation made it all flow very well even with the movement in the pieces! He worked with us on pricing and helped us get the best, most reasonable deal. We checked a number of different companies before choosing this one and we're so glad we waited because it saved us a ton!

I am more of a black or white kinda gal, so I will preface this review with a promise ""to follow up"" in the near future for a more definitive opinion. I also understand this is a fairly new location and they need to work out the kinks. They are pushing it with about a year of being open...

We have been here a few times before this review so I will give you a consolidated summary of the good and not so good.

One of our past experiences we had ordered our food and had to wait over an hour for it to come out while some people who came in after us were getting their orders before us. After we kicked up a fuss with our waitress she went in the kitchen and the food then came out luke warm and made wrong. I ordered my sandwich with cheese and after taking a bite found out there was none. So I sent it back for two deficiencies, cold sandwich, made wrong. Now this is what kills me... They put a piece of cold cheese on my already cold sandwich (you know, the one I already took a bite out of) and brought it back to me!!!! That is insane and begging for a negative review! It was obviously a calamity of errors between our waitress and the kitchen. After asking to speak to the Shift Manager because our experience was so horrible she did manage to make it right with her magical manager ways. 

On the same visit they had U.S. College Basketball on almost every tv but what doesn't make sense to me is the World Junior Hockey Championship was only on 2 small tv's that we could barely see from our table. Team Canada was playing, we live in Canada and we were at the Canadian Brew House. What????? 

Had I reviewed this location after this visit they would have received a one star rating and only because of their fabulous manager and that is about it. BUT I really want to like this place so I refrained.

This most recent visit when we were ordering drinks, I was interested in having a glass of wine. I know that they had been carrying Kim Crawford, Savignon Blanc by the glass, but to my dismay the wine list had changed (I had an old, sticky, menu in my hands). Not one decent white wine option and not one Savingnon Blanc available. Disappointed. Our Server suggested the Shiraz then I had to inform her that Shiraz is a red and Savingnon Blanc is white. Guess this is a ""Brew House"" so they may not know, but the staff should be familiar with their own menu. I know there are better options by the bottle, but I don't want a bottle, just a nice glass of wine with lunch. Not boat gas. They will need to change the 'by the glass' options before I come back again. And yes, I only drink wine~ not beer. 

Their 'by the glass' options are not the same as their 'by the bottle' options (which are pretty decent). Who is making these decisions and why do you choose to carry twice the inventory? Makes no sense at all! Obviously they are getting a contractual rebate or a lower cost/ higher margin from the 'by the glass' wine vendors.

I spoke to Drew, who was the shift manager about this when he came around to our table and he was fantastic! They are lucky to have him in their employ (he went around and spoke to everyone! A rarity). He was empathetic and offered a few different options to get around this swill they are now offering. Half price bottle Thursday or ordering a bottle and taking what isn't drank at the time, home. I will never do the latter because I won't pay double for a bottle of wine that I can buy at the liquor store, I am smarter than that and they have yet to win my loyalty as a customer to earn this. Drew did intrigue me with the Thursday option. 

Their Management Team is 'hands down' fantastic!!! And that is the only reason right now that they get three stars.

Just a few more minor notes. 1. The regular order of nachos is huge (like, can't wrap your arms around, kind of huge), perhaps they should offer a half size option. We felt really bad about wasting all the food that we couldn't eat because we were unaware of the size when we ordered. 2. Pickled jalapeños are waaaayyy better than fresh on nachos, we thought the fresh was just weird and a little uncommon. 3. Remove all wicker (nacho tray for example) from your restaurants. Anyone in the restaurant/ hospitality industry knows wicker can not be cleaned.

As a young lad playing baseball my team was sponsored by Grazie Ristorante and my third base coach was the owner. But either way it's still a great place to eat and has some of the best pizzas in town.

This place is absolutely hopping! I came here at a time that should be way beyond the dinner rush and I still waited 20mins, it felt almost as if I was waiting to eat in New York. So my suggestion is to try and snag a reservation if you wanna eat a little earlier. Luckily for me I wasn't pressed for time and had the luxury of sitting back and taking in the sights and sounds.

Service is amazing as the servers are very attentive and charming in that Italian, no need to be so formal, kind of way. They are also ninjas as they were always around without knowing. As soon as I was about to perk up my head to look and ask for something the server was already there asking me what I needed. I think if I dropped a napkin, they would catch it and lay it across my lap before it touched the floor.

The pizza is crispy, slightly chewy, thin, and has a perfect balance of sauce to cheese. The only thing holding this pizza back is the lack of a flavorful crust. For some odd reason the crust just seems dull. That being said this place holds a solid spot in the top 5 places to have a pie. Deelicious! The pastas here are also very good and the sauce to pasta balance is great, not too much, not too little.

Overall, I say it is definitely worth the trek to Grazie as the prices are not bad and the food is great. Definitely more bang for your buck at this joint. If it is more than two of you definitely ring for a reservation before showing up or you may look forward to waiting quite a while.

Cost is getting more and more expensive with teeth. Not to long ago a root-canal with crown cost around $300-$500. Now it's around $1300.
 The cheapest way to get out pain was to have it pulled. Next thing you know-you have only 5 teeth left on the upper part of your mouth. The last one pulled cost $500 with a fake tooth that you couldn't eat with. 

The Dentist have what's called an ""Implant"" replacing that tooth with a fake one that's held in your mouth with a screw, at around $1500 per tooth. sometimes more and sometimes a little less. A full set of choppers can cost over 20k. 
You have to do the math on your mouth and see what the cost will add up over say the next few years on dental work. My teeth were on the way out and I decided to have the rest of my upper teeth removed and get some upper dentures. I got all sort of prices from Dentist on dentures from $1500 to $2500 for the screw in dentures, and was just for the upper part of my mouth. 

As I did my Yelp search on Dentures, I saw Affordable Dentures and I liked what I saw,so I went to the website and I could get a full set for around $500. There are some cost added to that like X-Ray's and extractions are extra but not over priced and If I went the cheapest way, It would have cost me under $1000 for a full set. I didn't do the cheapest but I save thousands. 

I printed out some coupons from there web site and saved 10% on the total bill. Dr. Chang not only knows her stuff but is extremely kind and understands the money is a huge part of peoples concern about dentures. There are several plans and teeth and I found no hidden cost. Everything is explained in the first 30 minutes, (Price-procedure and what to expect.) 
Extractions cost $80 per tooth, 
The extractions were painless at the time, only a few hours later is when I had to hit the pills. 

I received what's called ""Healing Dentures"" right after the teeth were pulled, I will use them for the next year as my gums and mouth heals then I will get another set that should last me several years or longer. Both sets are in the packet I chose so I don't have to pay anymore unless I upgrade.

Dr Chang spent around 4 hours working on my mouth. Making sure I was in no pain. I was treated with care and compaction like I was a member of her family. 

Good customer service is when the office or company call's you the next day to find out if you have any problems or questions on what ever you had purchased or procedure you had done. This is generally done by someone in the office.   
I received a call from Dr.Chang herself! I have never had a Doctor call me on a follow up call and it was 3 hours after I left, around the time that the nova-cane was wearing off. She wanted to know if I had gotten my pills and If I was taking them, and If I had any questions, I could call her anytime. That just doesn't happen, The Doctor calling me. I feel that's above good customer service.  5 Star + 5 more in my book.

Affordable Dentures is a must check out if you are thinking of getting dentures for the first time or you just need a new set.

Send me a note if you have any questions.",31.0,"N3In8KnF6--3HP6I7HFLFQ","['david', 'review', 'bad', 'teeth', 'past', 'years', 'teeth', 'removed', 'cost', 'getting', 'expensive', 'teeth', 'long', 'ago', 'root', 'canal', 'crown', 'cost', 'cheapest', 'way', 'pain', 'pulled', 'thing', 'know', 'teeth', 'left', 'upper', 'mouth', 'pulled', 'cost', 'fake', 'tooth', 'couldn', 'eat', 'dentist', 'called', 'implant', 'replacing', 'tooth', 'fake', 'held', 'mouth', 'screw', 'tooth', 'little', 'set', 'choppers', 'cost', 'math', 'mouth', 'cost', 'add', 'years', 'dental', 'work', 'teeth', 'way', 'decided', 'rest', 'upper', 'teeth', 'removed', 'upper', 'dentures', 'got', 'sort', 'prices', 'dentist', 'dentures', 'screw', 'dentures', 'upper', 'mouth', 'yelp', 'search', 'dentures', 'saw', 'affordable', 'dentures', 'liked', 'saw', 'went', 'website', 'set', 'cost', 'added', 'like', 'ray', 'extractions', 'extra', 'priced', 'went', 'cheapest', 'way', 'cost', 'set', 'cheapest', 'save', 'thousands', 'printed', 'coupons', 'web', 'site', 'saved', 'total', 'dr', 'chang', 'knows', 'stuff', 'extremely', 'kind', 'understands', 'money', 'huge', 'peoples', 'concern', 'dentures', 'plans', 'teeth', 'hidden', 'cost', 'explained', 'minutes', 'price', 'procedure', 'expect', 'extractions', 'cost', 'tooth', 'extractions', 'painless', 'time', 'hours', 'later', 'hit', 'pills', 'received', 'called', 'healing', 'dentures', 'right', 'teeth', 'pulled', 'use', 'year', 'gums', 'mouth', 'heals', 'set', 'years', 'longer', 'sets', 'packet', 'chose', 'pay', 'anymore', 'upgrade', 'dr', 'chang', 'spent', 'hours', 'working', 'mouth', 'making', 'sure', 'pain', 'treated', 'care', 'compaction', 'like', 'member', 'family', 'good', 'customer', 'service', 'office', 'company', 'day', 'problems', 'questions', 'purchased', 'procedure', 'generally', 'office', 'received', 'dr', 'chang', 'doctor', 'follow', 'hours', 'left', 'time', 'nova', 'cane', 'wearing', 'wanted', 'know', 'gotten', 'pills', 'taking', 'questions', 'anytime', 'happen', 'doctor', 'calling', 'feel', 'good', 'customer', 'service', 'star', 'book', 'affordable', 'dentures', 'check', 'thinking', 'getting', 'dentures', 'time', 'need', 'new', 'set', 'send', 'note', 'questions']","2015-05-15"

Etsu offers many lunch combos and I have difficulty choosing one. In the end, I opted for a spicy combo with 8 spicy salmon rolls and 6 spicy tuna rolls. It was pretty good, but not the best that I've had. 

The other combo featured 6 avocado rolls and 8 dynamite rolls, both of which I enjoyed more than my spicy rolls. The avocado roll, although simple, was creamy and delicious.

There are two ""phases"" of apartments here, basically it's one with ceiling fans and black appliances and one with no ceiling fans and white appliances.  There are a ton of different layouts though.  The prices are a little high, but average for living in Ballantyne (and I've heard they don't raise rent much year after year).  This is one of the more pet friendly neighborhoods in Ballantyne, so there are a lot of families with all different sized dogs.  Both pools are very nice, usually well kept too.  Although the pool by the office gets less use, so it gets a little less attention too - dirt on the bottom of the pool, dirty filters, etc.  There is a fitness center that's ok, lots of machines, but not a lot of weights and it's smaller than it looks on the website pictures.  Atkins Circle is right next door to LA Fitness, and within walking distance of a handful of restaurants.

It's small, but roomy, and has a homey feel to it. The people that work there (and many of the diners) are hipsters.The guy that was our waiter had this really funky mustache - there's a certain charm to it - but it was quite uncommon. Don't let that define his character, he was a really good waiter. Be prepared to run into hipsters and the like who see themselves as ""sophisticated"" drinking their expensive coffee while reading a Hemingway novel whatever it may be while listening to music on their iPhone...Christ.

The portions were big and enough to fill me up. At first I wondered if I should order to entree's, but one was enough.

The downside to Lucky's is the wait. It took 45 minutes for the staff to seat us due to high demand. And waiting in that small space, packed with people for 45 minutes is not fun at all. Luckily, we were able to peruse the space around the restaurant outside, though we rushed in after about 10 minutes because it was so cold. The other downside is the time Lucky's is open - only until 3pm every day. They only do lunch, breakfast, and brunch. Which stinks for those who would like to come in for dinner. But what can you do?

For those wanting to try a very unique restaurant, try luckys! 9/10 times it won't dissapoint.

The level of service at this place is top-notch, the sort of service and expertise you secretly hope for (and pay for) at small boutiques. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and brought to an associate who got to work getting to know my feet. They asked me what I was looking for and what my activity level was, watched me walk around, correctly pointed out some orthopedic abnormalities that needed correcting, and set about looking for precisely the right sort of shoe for my lifestyle and physiology. We then tried on at least eight pairs of shoes, covering a wide gamut of options in terms of shapes, fits, and designs. All during this, he answered questions I had about running shoes, their mechanics, their care, and other sundry things that I've always wanted answered but never knew anyone knowledgeable enough to answer them.

In short, the service here is impeccable. And if you want anything better than the cheapest disposable sneakers from Zappo's, then come here and buy the right pair.

I had called probably about 6 different companies to get some different bids thinking it could be a big project. Ended up cancelling them all after Hunter left. From the moment we spoke to Troy my wife I and I knew this was an honest and hard working company. Very understanding, knowledgeable, trustworthy, and professional. 

Hunter called with an extremely professional and polite heads up that he would be arriving in 20-25 minutes, and was right on time. 

I can't say enough about the kind of person Hunter is. A hard working, honest, and very knowledgeable person. He took the time to assess the issue, explain it to us, and what the proper fixes would be. Hunter even went above and beyond and helped fix things that caught his eye in our attic. I must note that the attic is way hotter than even the temperature outside. Nevertheless, Hunter spent a long time up there fixing issues and taking the time to explain them to us. Just an all around great human being. Hard to find honest, humble, and hard working companies and this is definitely one of those companies. 

Hunter also installed a new Nest thermostat for us and helped with programming. I would 100% time and time again go with this company and specifically Hunter and Troy! I don't write reviews often but thought that they more than deserved this one! We felt like we gained a friend through this all! Thank you again!

But if you are looking for a hotel where you can get some sleep then perhaps consider another hotel.  Maybe you are a golf person and like early tee times.  Then this is your dream location.  The hotel and Stone Creek Golf Course share the same property (but are independently owned according to the hotel staff).  I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip and was placed on the golf course side of the hotel.  Nice views but do not be fooled.  3:30 AM the maintenance crew started to manicure the lawns.  A golf cart with their brights on shines light on the course (and into your room) while the lawn mower meticulously cuts the greens.  This happened 2 out of the three nights I stayed there.  Then at 6 AM the golf course PA system kicks in to announce golfer's tee times.  

When I complained to the hotel staff I was told that there was nothing they could do and that the General Manager had been aware of this problem for some time.  It is my opinion that the hotel cares more about their relationship with the golf course than with their hotel guests.  If you MUST stay here then insist on a room on the opposite side of the hotel from the golf course.",5.0,"yNH_k_S1bnfrXISQwHHmEg","['early', 'tee', 'time', 'maybe', 'place', 'looking', 'hotel', 'sleep', 'consider', 'hotel', 'maybe', 'golf', 'person', 'like', 'early', 'tee', 'times', 'dream', 'location', 'hotel', 'stone', 'creek', 'golf', 'course', 'share', 'property', 'independently', 'owned', 'according', 'hotel', 'staff', 'recently', 'stayed', 'hotel', 'business', 'trip', 'placed', 'golf', 'course', 'hotel', 'nice', 'views', 'fooled', 'maintenance', 'crew', 'started', 'manicure', 'lawns', 'golf', 'cart', 'brights', 'shines', 'light', 'course', 'room', 'lawn', 'mower', 'meticulously', 'cuts', 'greens', 'happened', 'nights', 'stayed', 'golf', 'course', 'pa', 'kicks', 'announce', 'golfer', 'tee', 'times', 'complained', 'hotel', 'staff', 'told', 'general', 'manager', 'aware', 'problem', 'time', 'opinion', 'hotel', 'cares', 'relationship', 'golf', 'course', 'hotel', 'guests', 'stay', 'insist', 'room', 'opposite', 'hotel', 'golf', 'course']","2013-04-24"

It's like Happy Dog stopped moving with the earth's axis after The Fumble and remained too scared of what Cleveland sports might bring in the 90s and aughts to move forward. I wish I would've followed their lead on that one. 

Get at least two hot dogs here: One you create and one from the suggested list. I'd go with the Chef's choice: Louisiana remoulade, bacon spiked southern greens, smoked gouda, and a fried egg that was both crispy and runny. The bacon greens give it a nice, almost potato-chip like crunch and the poppyseed bun holds up well enough considering it looks like the Octomom's pregnant stomach trying to hold everything in. (And If you've never been treated to that visual paradise, be thankful or Google image search ""Octomom pregnant stomach."")

The dog itself has a slight reddish tinge to it and juices of sodium and fat rush out and cascade down the meat when your teeth cut through the casing. My unsophisticated palate couldn't really find the gouda but my stop at Happy Dog did find something I haven't been able to find in NYC or Philly: The best hot dog I've ever had.

What did it for me was the cleanliness.  My friend's pillow case was dirty, and the bathroom had not been cleaned. We mentioned the issue to the front desk. They asked what we preferred, to have it cleaned or switch rooms.  We changed rooms.
In the 2nd room there was garbage sitting on the window ledge..obviously overlooked by housekeeping.  However we didnt want to switch again and the rest of it looked spic and span, so we stayed.  The head of housekeeping called us after arriving to apologize. And also sent up complimentary wine with a fruit and cheese plate.  It was a very nice gesture.  
We also left a phone charger in the old room and didn't realize it until after we turned in the keys, and security immediately went and got it for us.  Again, the service was great.
Happy with our new digs until later that night..just a short way down the hall..maybe 20 feet? There was a huge wedding party going on at an end room..Doors open, people spilling into the hall..  It was pretty late when the final revelers cleared out and they were not quiet doing so. We didn't say anything about it because it was a late night for us anyway, but I cannot imagine what the rooms closer to them were experiencing. Nothing like having a bunch of loud, drunk people partying outside your door.. It seems odd to me that a hotel would put a party room next to hotel rooms. 
So, while I enjoy the ambiance of the hotel itself because it is gorgeous, and the staff we encountered were great, I just can't get passed the cleanliness factor, and a hotel putting a party in amongst the other guests.  
My other little pet peeve with Omni (b/c they do this at another location I stay at) is nickel and dime you for everything, they charge for wi-fi (if you're not a select member), water left in the room is $6.00..breakfast options are not good..

We stopped in yesterday before going to the mall for some holiday shopping, excited to try the food and see the renovations.  It started out fine enough - the bartender was friendly and informative about wine flights and beers and even let me try the curry sauces with my fish and chips sandwich since I had a hankering for Indian food.  

The sandwich was ok, needed salt and hot sauce, but solid.  Curry sauces were ok as well.  Wine flights were good.  Restaurant was nicely done - looked very similar to what it used to.  

The bartender told us he had to leave and could we check out - no big deal (although annoying since we were still eating and were planning on ordering more drinks).  We did and left a 30% tip (thanks for the curries!!) A few minutes later, I tried to order a glass of wine, but the whoever had taken over the bar, was too busy chatting about boys (so loud we could overhear the conversation) with other waitresses, she refused to come over.  After a few tries, and finally yelling excuse me! she came over and I asked for a glass of chardonnay or for someone who could serve me, since the bartender had to leave for the day.  She (I learned from the hostess, who was very nice, was named Jade, I think) told me in a super rude tone and a NECK SNAP, that he did not leave but was taking lunch and she DID NOT KNOW what I was drinking.    Umm, I asked for a chardonnay.   I don't care, get me whatever!  I'm easy going! Or ask what I want.  Don't neck snap at me!

Reposado is a great little tequila bar comprised of a narrow room leading into a great little patio. The bar is filled with a plethora of different tequilas, from the economical brands to the well priced higher labels. Blessed with a great staff that cares about tequila, this sophisticated lounge is the perfect place to try to convince someone you're not what you are. Just in case what you're not is a tequila drinker, feel free to look out of place with a non tequila beverage - they do offer them there.

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
I'd suggest talking to the bartender. A flight is always a great call - this is basically a tequila sampler. See Kat's review for the more detailed description. Whatever you do, don't order a shot of Cuervo.

LOCATION NOTES
On the East side of Ossington, just South of Dundas.

SERVICE NOTES
The staff seem to more accurately be described as tequila ambassadors than servers. At least our server did. A great knowledge of tequila and a wonderful understanding of tequila novices. Let's put it this way, not only did we order a few rounds, I went out the next day and bought a bottle of nice tequila - armed with the knowledge of what makes a good tequila and a new found love for it.

The location was odd to say the least. I felt like I was walking into an outhouse through a small corridor, but the weirdness of the locale was the only downside to my food experience. 

The decor was extremely tacky but it allowed the food to be the real star. 

Hubby ordered the famous bacon Mac n cheese burger. It looked scrumptious and he assures me it was. Messy but tasty. 

I got the turkey sandwich with thick sliced turkey, bbq potato chips, slaw and cranberry sauce on a pretzel hoagie. It was fantastic! The potato chips gave a great crunch and added a smoky flavor to the hearty savory flavor of the turkey and slaw combo.

Or go to both. Whichever floats your boat. 

The parking lot for this outlet is HUGE which makes it easy to find a spot.. unless you come here for Black Friday shopping like I did in which case, it was hell.

There are shops inside and there are shops outside. Food court is located right in the middle with a variety of food options so you're sure to find something you like or you can go for Auntie Anne's pretzels that are located at one of the entrances of the mall. Bonus: there's a bathroom area near the food court.

The museum is divided into three buildings all of which are connected underground. The entrance is currently into the 'new' museum and if you want to visit the decorative arts or Canadian pavilion you need to go down a couple of floors to get to the rest of the exhibits.

The museum is a nice mix of permanent collections and temporary exhibitions. While I was there the Pompeii exhibit was the big draw but I actually found the Partners in Design exhibit on the efforts of Alfred H. Barr, Jr. and Philip Johnson to bring the Bauhaus to MoMA more interesting. 

Another section of the museum I very much enjoyed this visit was the Canadian pavilion. Last time my weary feet hit the Inuit art and failed to break through. But seeing what Canadian artists were doing from the 1880s through 1960s - a time period in which I am very familiar with the works of European and American artists - was actually rather fascinating.

We ordered the Cuban Rueben with onion rings and a pizza with bacon, onions, and black olives. It didn't take long for our food to come which was nice since we were starving. Hands down the Cuban Reuben is one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. It is a Reuben but has pulled pork on it. The pork enhances the other flavors of a Reuben-especially the brown mustard. The portions of items on the sandwich were perfect. Sometimes places get heavy handed with sauerkraut and it is the only flavor you get. That is definitely not the case here. The onion rings were large and crunchy. They give you a hearty portion of them. 
The pizza was a lot bigger than we expected. It was literally covered with toppings. They are very generous with them. The crust is not a thin crust but leans toward a crunch. The bacon was actually a light flavor and married well with their pizza sauce.

At first, I was going to skip that exhibit, but our friend wanted to go in with his toddler who doesn't walk yet.  So I followed suit by scooping up the little bug and carrying her in.  All those green and orange pool noodles suspended from the ceiling frankly scared me.  I'm so glad that our friend dove in, otherwise I wouldn't have experienced the unique forest.  Pretty quickly our little walking bug was on her feet and navigating the sea of noodles herself.  There are some areas of the forest where there are no noodles, which gives you a breather.  There are also structural poles in there, but they wisely placed foam barriers to keep the little ones from tripping and bonking.

It is hard to pick one favorite part of the museum.  For our toddler group, I loved the under 3 room.  It isn't like Seattle's CM room for the younger set, where kid of any age enter at will and can wreak havoc.  Here they actually monitor the room and they don't let the older kids in.  Frankly, they have more places to go in the museum so I appreciate having a place for that age set.  She loved the under 3 room, from the slides to the boardwalk to the in-floor air vent.  She even was enticed to crawl, as there are several exhibits and play spaces to check out.  For the young infants, they had these round, pillowy structures that you can place the babes in.  Our little wiggler wouldn't stay in it though, obviously.  

Having to take off our shoes to go into the under 3 room did not freak me out.  Why would I want our toddlers crawling through some of those structures where dirty shoes have been?  Not something I'm into during cold & flu season.

The cafe closes early but we were able to grab some snacks (imperative with toddlers).  I was impressed to find fruit packages of blueberries, grapes & melon but also loved that they had Eli's cheesecake and ice cream.  I'm still nursing and need the extra calories now and then!  Of course, they had milk and juice, too.

The art in the texile pizza kitchen room is great- lamps that look like tea cups & saucers, art made of cutlery.  The nearby room is pretty cool, with the ball track that makes sound and other exhibits that feature balls and little trains and gravity working.

I thought that the staff did an excellent job reigning in the too energetic kids that were throwing balls and cars down the tracks.  I don't know how the staff can maintain their composure.

Other yelpers mention that the entry fee is steep but it looks like the museum is undergoing lots of renovation.  The climbing structure they are working on is pretty impressive.  They need every penny they can get to keep construction on the exhibits.  I was sad that they had no reciprocal memberships with other cm's, but the staff said that they can't afford to offer that feature right now.

This was definitely a highlight of our trip.  We are far from likely to go back to Phoenix but this museum is now my gold standard for cm's.",4.0,"y-XxUFQR_0WfAHaWdPDt2w","['got', 'lost', 'noodle', 'forest', 'going', 'skip', 'exhibit', 'friend', 'wanted', 'toddler', 'walk', 'followed', 'suit', 'scooping', 'little', 'bug', 'carrying', 'green', 'orange', 'pool', 'noodles', 'suspended', 'ceiling', 'frankly', 'scared', 'glad', 'friend', 'dove', 'wouldn', 'experienced', 'unique', 'forest', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'little', 'walking', 'bug', 'feet', 'navigating', 'sea', 'noodles', 'areas', 'forest', 'noodles', 'gives', 'breather', 'structural', 'poles', 'wisely', 'placed', 'foam', 'barriers', 'little', 'ones', 'tripping', 'bonking', 'hard', 'pick', 'favorite', 'museum', 'toddler', 'group', 'loved', 'room', 'isn', 'like', 'seattle', 'cm', 'room', 'younger', 'set', 'kid', 'age', 'enter', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'actually', 'monitor', 'room', 'let', 'older', 'kids', 'frankly', 'places', 'museum', 'appreciate', 'having', 'place', 'age', 'set', 'loved', 'room', 'slides', 'boardwalk', 'floor', 'air', 'vent', 'enticed', 'crawl', 'exhibits', 'play', 'spaces', 'check', 'young', 'infants', 'round', 'pillowy', 'structures', 'place', 'babes', 'little', 'wiggler', 'wouldn', 'stay', 'obviously', 'having', 'shoes', 'room', 'freak', 'want', 'toddlers', 'crawling', 'structures', 'dirty', 'shoes', 'cold', 'flu', 'season', 'cafe', 'closes', 'early', 'able', 'grab', 'snacks', 'imperative', 'toddlers', 'impressed', 'fruit', 'packages', 'blueberries', 'grapes', 'melon', 'loved', 'eli', 'cheesecake', 'ice', 'cream', 'nursing', 'need', 'extra', 'calories', 'course', 'milk', 'juice', 'art', 'texile', 'pizza', 'kitchen', 'room', 'great', 'lamps', 'look', 'like', 'tea', 'cups', 'saucers', 'art', 'cutlery', 'nearby', 'room', 'pretty', 'cool', 'ball', 'track', 'makes', 'sound', 'exhibits', 'feature', 'balls', 'little', 'trains', 'gravity', 'working', 'thought', 'staff', 'excellent', 'job', 'reigning', 'energetic', 'kids', 'throwing', 'balls', 'cars', 'tracks', 'know', 'staff', 'maintain', 'composure', 'yelpers', 'mention', 'entry', 'fee', 'steep', 'looks', 'like', 'museum', 'undergoing', 'lots', 'renovation', 'climbing', 'structure', 'working', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'need', 'penny', 'construction', 'exhibits', 'sad', 'reciprocal', 'memberships', 'cm', 'staff', 'said', 'afford', 'offer', 'feature', 'right', 'definitely', 'highlight', 'trip', 'far', 'likely', 'phoenix', 'museum', 'gold', 'standard', 'cm']","2010-01-27"

The food is OK, yes you may not believe me, you saw this shit on Man vs. Food of course its good!! THEY HAVE NEAT STUFF ON THE WALLS! THE WAIT STAFF IS MADE UP OF COOL HIPSTERS! SO MANY BEARDS!

I was decidedly underwhelmed upon my first visit, but I got the deep fried sandwich with jalapeños, and at the time I just figured I shouldn't get an entire deep fried sandwich. My interim visits weren't memorable.

This most recent time I went (yesterday) was for a friends birthday, I happened to be in town and I wanted to take him out, he chose Melt.  When we walked in as they were seating us I whispered to the girl that it was his birthday ""we don't do anything for birthdays"" ok well I'd gladly pay you for a surprise dessert, do you fucking take money for desserts people order?! That is all I really wanted, actually I secretly go to restaurants to scam free things on people's birthdays its my only hobby aside from cat hoarding.

I got a salad and a cup of chili, I think they could pay a little more attention to the salads, it was iceberg with about 3 pieces of arugula mixed in, whatever its ruff age. It claimed to have sun dried tomatoes on it, but they were stewed tomatoes that had maybe been dried for a bit. I got cheddar on the salad (should've gotten blue) and it was clear that the cheese was for the grilled cheese, by all means yes use the same cheese but perhaps shred it in a way more suited to salads.  It was all really small pieces of cheese that ended up on the plate because they were too small for the fork.  Nit picky I know, but damn make the entire menu work.

So we are leisurely eating and getting caught up, mind you it is my friend's birthday and we haven't caught up in months.  Before I even touched my chili she brought us boxes for EVERYTHING. Slow. Your. Fucking. Roll. And let us eat.  As we were leaving I saw why she rushed us, there was a substantial wait for meat/cheese mediocrity.

So to all you poor souls waiting an hour or more to eat here go somewhere else and go here when you have time at 3 in the afternoon. 

I'm not going to lie and say I'll never go back because everyone in the tri county area has a boner for this place and when I come into town we often just end up here.

Once inside you can see tightly situated tables but it is still possible to have private conversations as everyone else is also talking, so the coziness still works. The noise level is not bad at all. 
We were all satisfied with our meals comprising of a several appetizers and mains. 
The soup of the day was piping hot. I had some crab cakes and dipping sauce. They were delicious but the cakes were a little too soft and sort of mushy.
For the main I had sea food pasta in a tomato based sauce. The fish was fresh and cooked just right in a deliciously seasoned sauce. 
My wife had the salmon, and mango sauce with vegetable risotto which found to be delightful. 
The wine selection is decent and we enjoyed our Chianti Gabianno reserve choice.
Over all a good restaurant with excellent service complemented with ambiance and coziness.

I went on a Saturday for an afternoon game in mid-March. The game had already begun and there was a long line on arrival. When we finally got near the front after about 10 minutes there people cutting in, it was not clear where to line up, and I ended up having to cut into another line when I was moved at the last second for having a bag. Not very well organized. Generally, though, staff friendly and helpful. We were offered directions while waiting for our last friend to get through the gate, and there were a bunch of staff saying goodbye and thank you when we left.

The stadium is a pretty good size and it was quite full. It has a different feel from a big-league stadium, smaller, friendlier, and a bit more relaxed. I thought the atmosphere was comparable to an AT&T stadium game - busy, friendly people, lots of cheering and little jeering. 

The service at the food and drink stands was super friendly and efficient.

When my original plans for the evening were called on account of illness, Shari ""pizza guru"" M. took me up on a last-minute suggestion that she finally introduce me to the Red Lantern she had been talking about since she FTR'd it a month ago.

Two entrances to this place (front and rear, surprisingly) make it an ideal spot to grab a bite and a pint if you're running from somebody.  Ceilings are high, and they've left the concrete-and-truss canopy in place for a modern feel that grew on me after the fact while I wrote this review.  A dark wood floor with some character and new dark tables offset the off-white ceiling and bar nicely. The most distinctive feature was definitely the public-facing hand-washing area between the men's and ladies' rooms.  I'm a big advocate of public hand-washing sinks -people are more likely to wash (and to do a good job of it) if they know they're being watched.  

Shari strongly suggested a pizza or calzone; notwithstanding my preference for getting something different from my company, the Classic pizza (pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms and red peppers) was so strongly recommended that I went for it despite the fact that Shari had ordered the same thing in folded format.  Delicious and filling!  Crust was a bit soggy in the center, probably from all the chunky tomatoes and peppers.  Ordering the calzone will no doubt aid in avoiding this problem, and I'll go that way in future.

Deduct one point for a lame beer selection.  They have Steamwhistle (which I refuse to spell as two words) and a bunch of big-brand stuff like Bud and Canadian (ugh).  I think Toronto's beer drinker is a bit more sophisticated these days, and it's a shame that some restaurants haven't caught up.

Clientele seemed to be locals/regulars who knew each other and the DJ. Karaoke DJ was pretty damn uptight though. House rules are you can't cuss on the little stage they have - so no songs with profanity. Their song selection already seemed pretty weak so I figured they had already weeded out all the songs that had any bad words. Then some guy started singing Closer by Nine Inch Nails and I suppose the DJ was not familiar with the song because right when it got to the part that goes ""I want to f*ck you like an animal"" she stopped the music and would not continue until the singer promised to substitute the word ""truck"" in place of the offending word.

However, this time, we decided to also try the Golden Steer. I'd been there before and like the ambiance (even though it's a bit worn), but I don't like being cheated, so I won't be back. Read on if interested.

We arrived early and had a drink at the bar. I ordered a very standard Cosmo, which the very grouchy bartender, who barely acknowledged us, is apparently unable to make. I asked him what he had put in it that made it so sweet, and he responded that he'd put in... pineapple juice! It was quite yucky and it was obvious that I was not happy, yet he made no attempt to make me happy. My dad doesn't like the fuss, so we paid for the drinks and took them into the dining room when the table was ready.

The nice waiter asked me if everything was ok with my drink, and I said I hated it. He was fantastic and immediately offered to give me a real Cosmo (for free, of course). He went and fetched it from the bar and I was definitely pleased with that. The food was decent, but not outstanding. However, when the  bill came, I saw that I was charged for a Cosmo -- what a job! I'd paid for the first one at the bar and the second one was supposed to be comped. Turns out the hostess and the waiter thought I'd ordered the first one from the waiter and thus charged me for it. How is that possible? They saw me walk into the dining room with the drink and he was the one who asked me if I had enjoyed it, and since he hadn't taken the order, it was clear that the drink must have come from the bar. I was quite flabbergasted by this and told the waiter to take the drink off the bill. He said it would take 15 minutes to do this, as they were so busy. What? THat's insane. As an alternative, he offered another drink instead. I didn't want another drink. as I had to drive, but they made it very clear to me that it was terribly inconvenient for them to remove this drink -- which was their mistake in the first place.

Old School is a bar that looks designed to simulate an 80s/90s hangout spot. There are arcade games lining the walls, foosball tables, pool tables, and board games available upon request. It really did a good job of bringing out some childhood nostalgia. We ended up playing Jenga, Battle of the Sexes, and Yahtzee and had quite a good time.

The food menu was your typical pub food - nothing too adventurous here. I ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak because I remember the picture on the online menu looked amazing. Others in my party had the poutine fries and the chicken and waffles.

The bar menu was surprisingly not very deep... When we asked what beers they had, our waitresses' reply was ""domestic and imported"" (what?).

The wait time for our food was quite long, but this was to be expected with a new restaurant (we were there in the 4th day of business). However, one thing that bothered me is that my food came nearly 20 minutes after the rest of my party got their food. This is way too big of a gap and led me to believe that my order was forgotten. In the meantime, I just tried a few of the poutine fries, which were actually quite good. Based on my friends' reactions, the chicken and waffles were pretty good as well. 

When my food finally came, my first thought was ... this looks nothing like the online menu! Where was the breading? Where was the gravy? I didn't think much of it then, and just ate. The fries were good, but the chicken just tasted mediocre... It definitely did not take much effort to make. 

Looking at their menu on their website afterwards, I realized that none of our dishes looked like the website pictures! So I decided to do a quick google search, and their chicken steak picture was actually from MyRecipes.com (http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-fried-steak-3)! Really Old School? I ordered that dish based on the picture on your website!

If you've been to the restaurant, you'll notice that the pictures used on the website aren't of the actual restaurant either. I'm not sure why this was done? In the age of Instagram where a picture truly is worth a thousand words, why misrepresent your menu, much less your entire space? If the Contact page didn't specify the address, I would be certain this was a website for a different restaurant.

I want Old School to do well because I like their concept of bringing childhood nostalgia to a restaurant.

The carnitas tacos are really good but I recommend ordering them without tomato. By far my favorite is the Nevada Burrito and I would recommend everyone to try it. It is a carne asada burrito with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and the awesome kick are the french fries inside the burrito. 

The restaurant is a little cram and they are super popular so their flow is pretty constant. You are better off ordering ahead or ordering to go.

I've been looking off and on for good Japanese food that doesn't break the bank since I moved to Vegas a year ago, and I've finally found it.

I've been there twice this week already and everything has been great.

The first night I had katsudon and gyoza. The gyoza is quite nice, and has a turkey filling.  The katsudon was superb - everything cooked just right - nothing overdone, nothing underdone, and tasted just like I've had in Japan.

The next night, I had shoyu ramen, which was also excellent. Flavorful broth, good noodles, half a boiled egg, a few slices of beef, those spiral-looking fish cakes I can never remember the name of, and some vegetables.

I am definitely looking forward to future visits, and may return to post about more items :) 

Update: Went there again, tried the takoyakiten, and it was excellent - just a slightly different name for what I'm used to seeing as simply ""takoyaki""

Since this was my first time, I needed to try the some of the marinated fish and dressings.  I chose the house dressing, tuna, octupus with half rice and half salad. I was bug eyed at the big portion of salad and rice. It's more filling than ordering sushi. This was like deconstructed sushi. I devoured it.

I've never been to their Scottsdale location, but so glad they found a Chandler location because I think that helps keep the price affordable.  

Although I know fish is not always in great supply, I will savor every bite of every order from Ahipoki, Chandler..I feel clean eating here and not cleaned out....Telling everybody!",1.0,"wBg8kiWP6ndcWRCfcsVeVw","['stumbled', 'restaurant', 'way', 'errands', 'fate', 'returned', 'portland', 'talked', 'restaurant', 'poke', 'mon', 'hawthorne', 'blvd', 'high', 'traffic', 'street', 'restaurant', 'galore', 'sadly', 'couldn', 'incorporate', 'trip', 've', 'hankering', 'poke', 'loving', 'price', 'regular', 'bowl', 'scoops', 'fish', 'toppings', 'listed', 'wow', 'including', 'seaweed', 'sesame', 'seeds', 'crispy', 'onions', 'edamame', 'jicama', 'avocado', 'extra', 'time', 'needed', 'try', 'marinated', 'fish', 'dressings', 'chose', 'house', 'dressing', 'tuna', 'octupus', 'half', 'rice', 'half', 'salad', 'bug', 'eyed', 'big', 'portion', 'salad', 'rice', 'filling', 'ordering', 'sushi', 'like', 'deconstructed', 'sushi', 'devoured', 've', 'scottsdale', 'location', 'glad', 'chandler', 'location', 'think', 'helps', 'price', 'affordable', 'know', 'fish', 'great', 'supply', 'savor', 'bite', 'order', 'ahipoki', 'chandler', 'feel', 'clean', 'eating', 'cleaned', 'telling', 'everybody']","2016-07-30"

We have been coming back since its close to where we live.  I like the idea that we can make our own bowl, we can pick and choose the soup base, the toppings and either fresh or regular noodles we want in our bowl.  Their original beef broth soup base is really flavourful but not overly salty at all (unlike most of the viet place out there).  As for toppings, my favourite are the rare beef and briskets.  The rare beef are so tender and soft.  We also like to order C11 - the Bun Bo Hue (BBH), I love the level of spiciness and the rich flavour of the soup.  

One thing the restaurant should really improve on is their service.  It is always difficult to get a hold of the servers and ask for the menus and teas. Also, you sure need a lot of patience for the food to come as we waited at least 15-20 mins for our food.

We planned a 2 week vacation and had initially intended to have a friend watch our dogs. But we found ourselves in a bind when our friend bailed on us at the last minute. We checked pricing for pet hotels and found the pricing per day to be outrageous for 2 dogs. Thankfully, I found these positive yelp reviews and I am forever grateful. Theresa and Kim arranged a time to come over to our house and meet the dogs prior to our departure. They really made us feel at ease by answering all questions. They were willing to follow any instructions we had in caring for the dogs and small household chores.

We left on vacation and things took a turn for the worse. Kim discovered a day after we left that our water level had dropped in our pool and the 1st step was exposed. Our pool filter had cracked and water was spraying everywhere! She helped us by turning off the pool pump and even spent extra time at our house filling up the pool with a garden hose! She then recommended a pool guy who could come out to the house to fix the filter. We were a little concerned that the dogs would run out of the gate if the pool man came to our house alone. So she arranged to be present when he arrived to make his repairs. She kept us informed and up to date every step of the way with phone calls, pictures and text.

Although we were stressed on our vacation dealing with serious home repair issues from afar. We were extremely relieved when we came home to a repaired/functioning pool and 2 happy/healthy dogs.

For one, the dinner menu is somewhat limited (especially if you don't eat pork) and I found myself wishing I could just get something off the lunch menu. I had a decent meal that didn't cost me much, along with decent service that was kind of slow, but not unreasonable.

We started off with a bloody mary that's purported to have 10 flavors in it, but tasted more like it had 2. I had to load that thing up with hot sauce and pepper myself to keep it from tasting like a cup of thin tomato juice.

The southwest ""steak"" (read: random hunk of low-grade meat) was as bloody as a rare steak but as tough as a well-done one, and the marinade just tasted like black pepper and nothing else. It came with a pile of peppers that tasted like anything you'd get at a grocery store, and some green salsa that was pretty excellent on its own merit. 

So, the good. I also ordered a bowl of vegetarian chili that was perfectly satisfying even to a voracious carnivore. It was loaded with several different kinds of beans and had just the right amount of burn to it. The spices made the chili taste really warm and hearty; it left a great aftertaste that was perfectly hot without making you break a sweat and reach for the water.

My crappy steak also came with some soft, buttery fingerling potatoes that I would be sure to order again - on their own. They were sweet and creamy, almost like mashed potatoes.

Ultimately, Daisy Cafe's inconsistently good food as well as their slightly off-putting environment makes me ambivalent about getting a meal here again. But it does have its draws. I also grabbed a chocolate mousse-filled cupcake on the way out that was worth all 3 dollars I spent on it.

(don't get me wrong, there are amazing sofas and sectionals all over town but $5,000 plus for one is not ""doable"" for us).  The sales staff is very nice and can answer all your questions without some lame-o runaround like we got at some other stores.  

So we picked a really great leather set (sofa and love seat) and did the no interest thingy, it was a loan set up thru a bank, we didn't realize it was going to be done that way but whatever, we paid it off with zero interest b/c you CAN NOT and I repeat CAN NOT be late on a payment or else you end up paying for all interest and more.  These zero percent interest things can be tricky but with diligence and proper payment scheduling, it can be done.  Just watch it.  Don't be a foolio.

So once the first set was paid off, it was time to buy the next set.... a beautiful leather sectional.  Again, searched all over town, didn't find one we liked that was in out budget.  Went to the Room Store AND VOILA!  there she was )yes, the sectional is a she, she is too pretty to be a boy).  SO here we go again, another year of stressing out to make sure to NEVER miss a payment and we can say we survived the ""zero percent interest"" scam.

Instead of accommodating the simple request of a patron, he opted to have both TV's turned off, so that nobody could enjoy any of the games.

My boyfriend and I visited on Saturday morning. We got there a little before 9 and it wasn't very busy yet. In the parking lot there was a car with a backseat window smashed so that's awesome. I assume it happened overnight but who knows.

Anyway, we were sat right away and given menus. Our waitress came over and offered drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Considering we just sat down and this is a new restaurant that's not a chain, we said we needed a minute. She must have counted 60 seconds because she was back very quickly. I don't know what the hurry was but we ordered - I got the minimum wage (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes) and my boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy.

Our meals came out and the first thing we both noticed was my eggs. They looked really weird. Really crumbly and dry. They tasted kinda weird too - actually they didn't taste like anything - they were just bland and unappetizing. I'm guessing they were powdered? I've never had ""eggs"" like this before. The bacon was meh. The potatoes were pretty good and the homemade jam for the toast was good. (tip - ask for the jam, my toast came out with none) Boyfriend's biscuits were super dense. The sausage was overcooked and tough. For the price of the food, I would expect the quality to be much higher.

By the time we were done the place had filled up. When our waitress left our check and said ""have a nice day"" she wasn't even looking at us. How sincere.

We left feeling very unsatisfied and on the way out I commented that I wished it were still IHOP.

For full disclosure's sake I am typing this while a piece of Ethel M dark chocolate is melting in my mouth!

I'll be honest with you, I do not have a sweet tooth and I am not particularly crazy about chocolate, but I tell you, Ethel M Chocolate Factory and its Cactus Garden in Las Vegas is one of my favorite places to visit whenever I am there with a few first timers who are chocolate lovers! Over the years the setup of the factory has changed, but the basic idea is the same, you walk in (if at the right time) and get to see how the chocolate is made, then you end up at the store to taste and purchase a couple of your favorite chocolate flavors. This time I noticed that there is even a ""chocolate tasting"" room where for a fixed fee you get to sit and taste a few different flavors. 

TIP # 1: If you are on yelp, you might get a discount on the tasting fee when you check in, so do not forget that!

My taste for chocolate is very simple! I like it dark and bitter (the less the sugar, the better), but everyone has their preference and there are plenty of choices to pick from in the store.

TIP # 2: Always look around for what may be on sale, you could find your favorite chocolate for a much discounted price.

Finally, the cactus garden. I am not an expert on cacti, but every time I visit Ethel M, I walk around and educate myself on the different varieties of cacti. On a nice day this could be fun and will help you burn a couple of the calories you just consumed in the store in the form of delicious chocolate!",7.0,"ZNPI9K-JufHOs0wXkDv0HQ","['big', 'chocolate', 'fan', 'fun', 'disclosure', 'sake', 'typing', 'piece', 'ethel', 'dark', 'chocolate', 'melting', 'mouth', 'll', 'honest', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'particularly', 'crazy', 'chocolate', 'tell', 'ethel', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'cactus', 'garden', 'las', 'vegas', 'favorite', 'places', 'visit', 'timers', 'chocolate', 'lovers', 'years', 'setup', 'factory', 'changed', 'basic', 'idea', 'walk', 'right', 'time', 'chocolate', 'end', 'store', 'taste', 'purchase', 'couple', 'favorite', 'chocolate', 'flavors', 'time', 'noticed', 'chocolate', 'tasting', 'room', 'fixed', 'fee', 'sit', 'taste', 'different', 'flavors', 'tip', 'yelp', 'discount', 'tasting', 'fee', 'check', 'forget', 'taste', 'chocolate', 'simple', 'like', 'dark', 'bitter', 'sugar', 'better', 'preference', 'plenty', 'choices', 'pick', 'store', 'tip', 'look', 'sale', 'favorite', 'chocolate', 'discounted', 'price', 'finally', 'cactus', 'garden', 'expert', 'cacti', 'time', 'visit', 'ethel', 'walk', 'educate', 'different', 'varieties', 'cacti', 'nice', 'day', 'fun', 'help', 'burn', 'couple', 'calories', 'consumed', 'store', 'form', 'delicious', 'chocolate']","2018-04-30"

And puppy was chewing everything. A quick google search told me the things puppy was chewing on were toxic. So, they had to go. I called Show Ready, told Ed what we had in mind. Which was so basic. Artificial grass & rocks along both narrow sides of the house. No trees. No plants. No bushes or shrubs. Absolutely basic. Puppy needed room to run and since our backyard is your typical small & boxy Vegas backyard, we couldn't clutter it all up with trees & bushes. And we needed it quick. I called Ed on a Saturday and our backyard was done on Monday. Seriously. And it's perfect for us & puppy. It looks great. Ed suggested some boulders along the back wall and they are awesome.

I've even gotten a loaner for an oil change because it was going to take longer than expected. I don't like to waste time at a dealership when I could be getting errands done and freeing up the rest of my weekend and Lexus of Madison has always been kind enough to help me out. They also vacuum the interior after a car wash, which I found out from another luxury dealership isn't a given.

Unfortunately, now it is run down and trash. Talking to the office and expressing your concerns, resolves nothing. They will offer an excuse and say they will fix it but nothing is fixed. 

First, a couple of months ago, our upstairs neighbor spit down from the balcony and it landed on my husband who was standing on our balcony. When my husband told the guy that he spit on him, the guy laughed and went inside. My husband went to the office and told Koi. She asked my husband what he wanted her to do about it. She then offered a phone call to the neighbor but my husband declined since that would have resolved nothing. My husband did follow up with Koi, and was also inquiring about another issue, and she denied having any knowledge of the spitting incident. She out said she was never told about this; Yet when my husband spoke with a leasing office agent about the incident, Koi apparently told her about it because she said she ""heard about it"". 

Shortly after that, our downstairs neighbor was having what seemed to be a rock concert and the music was extremely loud and vibrating all of our walls and floor. I called the office and notified Koi and she said she would investigate. The assistant manager and a leasing agent came to my apartment to hear the noise for themselves and agreed that it was unacceptable. Not sure what the outcome was but the neighbor still blasts music to this day and I am told that the office will investigate each time. 

Another incident was when I was on my patio at night, I witnessed two guys in a white pick up truck breaking into vehicles. I called metro who responded quickly but not fast enough (the suspects got away), and I called our security. Our security took over 2 hours to respond and by this time metro had taken a report and left. Security called and said they saw nothing but would still do a report. I followed up with the office the following day and they said that there wasn't anything to be done and also informed me that the victim of one vehicle was out of town (military). 

One day I decided to go to the pool with my family and there were over 20 teenagers lounging around the area and swimming in normal clothes. Some were doing inappropriate things in the lounge chairs. Security strolled through and hung out with these individuals for approx. 15 minutes, laughing and talking, then left. One girl was pushed in by two guys and yelled at them saying ""I didn't plan on swimming since I'm on my period and don't have a tampon."" This same girl stayed in the pool. My family was disgusted so we left. Called the office the next day and the pool wasn't due to be cleaned until the following week. 

Lately, I have noticed the hallway floors are always filled with food, trash and stains. I called and spoke to a leasing agent and was told ""our manager is standing right here and I will relay that information"". After a week of nothing done, I called 23 times in 3 hours and finally, Koi answered the phone.  I was told that she will have it cleaned. She apologized for not answering and said that they only had one other person working that day. 4 days after the conversation with Koi, they hired a power washing company to clean the hallway. The power wash company made a bigger mess and didn't even finish the entire hallway. The next day, I was walking down the stairs and discovered that somebody let their dog crap on the newly ""cleaned"" stairs. I tried calling the office to report it and after 18 phone calls, nobody answered. I decided to go into the office to speak face to face about my problems. I walked into the office and THREE leading agents were sitting there and not helping anybody. Not sure why it's so difficult to answer the phone. I spoke with Kim (she is very nice and probably the best one that works in the office), and was told that there was nothing she could do about the stains but she will have somebody sent to clean the dog poop. When I asked why nothing can be done, she said the builders didn't put a seal on the pavement and because of that, the stains can't be lifted. She offered her managers email and said ""you can talk to Andrea about other possibilities."" I never followed up with Andrea nor did she follow up with me. I have continuously attempted to reach out to the office regarding complaints and nothing is ever fixed. I'm done trying. For paying over $1200 a month for 2 bedrooms you'd expect a little more accommodations and customer service. 

Bugs are out of control (roaches, spiders, earwigs, fruit flies, etc) pest control doesn't get the job done.

I actually clipped the article and put it on my fridge as I didn't want to forget to go there.  When we moved house the clipping moved with us, a constant reminder of a promise made to oneself.

After keeping the clipping for so long, I was just praying I hadn't made a huge mistake.  My prayers were answered, and I can proclaim that the Wokker lived up to it's billing (as far as the Metro was concerned at least).

Word to the wise, if you have a high-maintenance girlfriend (or boyfriend), DO NOT BRING THEM TO THIS RESTAURANT.  It's authentic chinese food, and the interior and decor are along much the same lines.  Let's just say you don't need to dress up in order to feel comfortable.  You will not impress a first date with this place.

That being said, if you like good chinese food at great prices, you will not be disappointed.  I recommend the set dinner, I had the duckling and (like the Metro columnist) I could be heard eliciting squeals of delight with every bite.  Vegetables and rice were very good too.  Spring rolls and wonton soup, the duckling with rice and vegetables, topped off with green tea ice cream, all for the very low price of $12.95.

My wife had the Pad-Thai, she was disappointed as there was a slightly burnt flavour to it (I had to taste it myself in order to critique it :)), even still I ended up finishing it for her as I hate to waste good food, that I owe to my late Irish granny who would give us stale biscuits (cookies to Canucks) when we came to visit.

Not a zoo but a place where animals are rehabilitated and sometimes live out their lives if they can't be released in the wild. They are only allowed to have visitors certain days, so when you see these offered, jump on it. Its good enough that you might want to plan a trip to AZ just for the days they are offering tours.

The tours last about two hours and are small groups. You will be as close to these animals as you ever will be. Some are AZ natives but many are not. There are bears, wolves, leopards, mountain lions, and many others. I was at the San Diego Zoo a few weeks ago, and this place is so much better. At a zoo half the animals are out-of-sight. Here they try to feed them when visitors are there so you see them all. Up close.  

Location: Probably around 25 minutes North of the 101 ans Pima Rd exit. There is about 0.5 miles on a dirt road, but its not bad. 

This place is all donation supported, with almost all volunteers. Tickets and even t-shirts are cheaper than you will pay at the zoo, and a better value.  These folks have been there for 21 years, but as others have said, neighbors have been complaining about the noise. These are neighbors that moved to the area LONG after the rehabilitation center was there. Dah!  Because of the Scottsdale has reduced the days they can have visitors, which has very negatively cut their revenue.

Now if you've never had crystal boba I recommend trying it and this place is the only one in the valley I've found that does it well.

The tea was strong and they put the perfect amount of syrup in it.

Since this brewery originated in Asheville, they clearly take their beer very seriously. They have a long list of ales, lagers, ciders, and so on that will satiate just about any taste. It is a spacious brewery that greatly utilizes its indoor and outdoor spaces. I don't think there's a bad seat to be found on the premises.

I decided to go for a flight that included the Ted light lime, CLT IPA, White Zombie and another that I forget. I was able to take a sip of the hopness monster (two thumbs up!) and split half of the peanut butter & jelly. The PB&J is available only by the can but they throw in a free koozie with purchase as an added bonus.

Another plus? They have multiple stalls in the ladies bathroom! I've noticed in a few breweries (that shall remain nameless), there are at most three stalls in the ladies room. Sorry that's just unacceptable and thankfully that's not an issue at Catawba.

Catawba does have its own private parking lot but it will fill up quickly on the weekend. Just to add to the charm, they have a couple of hammocks that you can choose to lay (swing?) as well as corn hole boards.

 I ordered Butternut Squash ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was soooo good, although there was too much cream sauce poured on top, my ravioli were buried.  But they tasted soooo good.  My sis had penne pasta with tomato sauce and zucchini.  It was very good, but HUGE portions!  She boxed it up so we could have dessert.

The place opened only four or five weeks before writing this review. I'm glad to report that for an all you can eat restaurant, the food was pretty much the best I've found in the city. That's saying a lot and they have dethroned my favourite Sushi place up near Yonge & Eg. 

As an AYCE Sushi place, I'd like to give them a 5-star rating but they are experiencing some growing pains. For the time being, they are understaffed and thus the service is slow. When we arrived, there were only 4 or 5 tables of customers, out of many many more, and it still took 20+ minutes before we got to place our first order. 

As I understand, they are also having difficulty setting up their iPad ordering system so that will take a few more weeks to get in place. Once that's done, our first ""problem"" will be resolved.

I would say that their staff are also fairly inexperienced because we never had our water/tea refilled without requesting it and even then, it took 10-15 minutes after several requests to make it happen. With all of these ""complaints,"" I can't give too much of a hit on this review because I'm confident that they will be resolved over time. 

On the way out, the manager spoke to us and asked for feedback on how they can improve so I'm sure the place is in good hands from a management perspective.

The price is also a bit high compared to the competition BUT that increased price is reflected in the significantly higher quality and selection of food. Their dessert menu is shockingly diverse and interesting compared to any other AYCE sushi place in the city!

KaKa, you've won my loyalty and you will see me return again several times as we wander through the year.

We ended up going for a late breakfast and it was simply the best breakfast I have ever had!

I ordered the Croque Madame mainly because of everyone going on and on about the French Fries they serve with it. I mean... everyone talks about them like they are some kind of narcotic and you need your fix to through the day. I waited eagerly for the plate to come to the table, grabbed a few fries, and... they were very good, but definitely not as good as everyone is saying. Maybe I hyped it too much, but I was expecting more.

Seriously though... To be honest, F the French Fries. The real star is the Croque Madame. That has to be THE best breakfast I have ever eaten. Toasted ham and cheese were very good, the brioche was even better, but I think the combination of everything with the slightly runny sunny side up egg and mornay sauce puts this way over the top.

I normally don't like to go to a particular restaurant twice in a single visit while in Vegas, but I think for this place I might make an exception (dinner one night and breakfast in the morning before leaving for home). The atmosphere is definitely casual (breakfast), there were both couples and families, and it doesn't have the snooty vibe to it.

He was pressed for time and couldn't come in for a fitting before our event (I just picked up the tux on his behalf). He noticed as he was getting dressed for the event that the clasp on the pants was broken and as a result the pants were unwearable. He ended up not being able to wear the tuxedo at all because of this. What good is a tuxedo jacket if there are no pants to go with it? He instead wore a suit of his own, which was not ideal as it was not in line with the dress code for the event. We did call and let Top Hat Tuxedo know what had happened, and the man I spoke to told us he would run a full refund by his manager and make a note in the file about it. 

When I showed up to return the tux however, I was offered a $10 refund on a $90 rental (none of which he even wore). I was able to talk them into a $20 refund instead (anything more than $20 needs to be approved by a manager, meaning the man I talked to on the phone never followed through on his promise to do this). I was told that ""most of these mistakes are usually caught during the fitting."" The implication here was that it was somehow our fault that they did not catch the defect earlier in the process. I would think that all elements of the tuxedo rental would be inspected as the tuxedo was being assembled for rental. The fact that Top Hat Tuxedo apparently needed several opportunities to catch the defect is not my problem.

The Spicy Beef Stew had good heat, broth was robust, hit the spot. But my delight came at the end of my meal: the waitress noticed I didn't finish the meat in my bowl (not because it wasn't tasty but due to my personal limits on meat consumption) and she said, ""next time you don't like the food, let us know and we change it for you"". Wow, that coming from an Asian restaurant tucked in a nondescript plaza - sure caught my attention!

The next thing that caught my eye was a picture of their Phnom Penh Dry Noodles on their takeout menu. Looked so much like my favourite Bak Chor Mee (minced pork noodles) from Singapore! So I went back the very next day to try it. Though it wasn't what I was hoping for, this would serve as my go-to dish next time I miss home. [By the way, if any of you find Bak Chor Mee in the greater Toronto area, please connect with me!]

The following week I decided to do takeout Chicken Pad Thai. Oh-my-goodness ~ it was Heavenly! The noodle stir-fry had dramatic flavours: generous lemongrass, sweet and mildly spicy. Balanced with just the right amount of crunchy veggies (raw bean sprouts + surprising dollop of pickled radish) and peanuts, I ate with relish. I think I would have punctuated my meal with ""this is SO good"" & several grunts of satisfaction, but I was out in public and yes, I'm shy.

The Spice Seeker that I am, I was THRILLED to see on the table 2 types of chillies you can add to your food: a chilli paste (milder) and pickled chilli slices (one thin sliver packs a huge punch!)

About 30 seats + 6 bar spots. 
Great value when you're extra hungry. 
$13 will get you double meat (4 pieces) + 0.50 for an extra bowl of noodles.

Waitress suggested a warm peach tea (premium! $1.50) which was nice in this -18degrees weather. The peach fragrance was delightful. 

I asked for half lean pork and half chicken cha siu. Both were perfectly seasoned and not dry. They offer 4 types of soup base; I chose black but wasn't a fan of it. It was supposed to be garlicky, but not enough for me. it had more of a charcoal flavour than garlic. So I was a bit disappointed there. Can't beat Kinton's spicy garlic ramen...mmmm
Noodles were nice, though I would've preferred more al dente. 

Our kind waitress offered toragashi (sp?) pepper spice, which was not fragrant, and sriracha for my friend's chicken karaage. the karaage wasn't crispy enough... maybe the oil wasn't hot enough? Or their potato starch ain't cutting it. chicken itself was juicy and offered with mayo dipping sauce.

My sister felt a bit uneasy with it at first, but she agreed to get a massage while I did the go at your own pace stuff.

There is a separate entrance for men and women.  They give you two towels and a ""gym outfit"" which is basically the most unflattering thing ever.  It's a hospital scrub-like top and then these stretchy linen shorts.  Then you also get a key to a locker. 

The locker room/lounge was very nice.  They had comfy chairs and several women were there napping or just watching tv.  They had a lot of amenities, including disposable razors, individually wrapped toothbrushes, hair products, etc.  It felt like they had put a lot of thought into what to make available.  Right off the lounge is the entrance for the upstairs area for both men and women, which I will get to.  There was also a dry salt sauna.  When you enter the glass door there, you enter the main spa area.  Immediately upon entering, there is a dry suana ahead and showers to your right (you have to shower before going in anywhere and anytime after you get out of a sauna).  To the left there is a warm tub with jets, a hot tub, a cold water tub, a salt steam sauna and a eucalyptus sauna.  Pro tip: if you are new to one of the ""wet"" saunas, sit on the bottom step.  It will not be as hot since the steam rises.  Also, breathe through your mouth and not your nose and just stay in for a couple minutes.  There was also a section of little showers where you could sit on a stool close to the ground.

The upstairs area was nice, but I hated having to wear my gym outfit.  The rooms were hot and I didn't feel like adding polyester blend to the mix was relaxing.  Also, they have signs posted, but let me just tell you: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU STEP INTO THE CLAY BALL SECTION.  I don't know why, but I thought the signs meant ""be careful when you step in the room"" as opposed to ""be careful when you step on the heaping pile of clay balls.""  Yeah, I'm an idiot.  Anyway, I fell and woke up a very nice Asian man who asked me if I was ok.  I was, but I decided to beeline out of there and decided that the ice room would be the best option.  It's basically like a walk in freezer that you sit in, though it wasn't quite as cold as a freezer.  I got to talking with someone in the ice room and completely forgot that I had left my sister and her massage had ended 45 minutes earlier.  I was so worried that she would be mad at me, but when I looked for her, I found her completely naked, in the cold tub, talking gingerly with another woman.  I honestly don't know what it is about this place, but it was very freeing to be able to walk around with no clothes on and my sister ended up loving it, even though she was initially scared to be naked.  She said her massage was incredible, as well.

Honestly, this was the highlight of my trip to Vegas.  If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  It can be intimidating at first, but it was so, so nice and relaxing and freeing.

B) broke

When that happens, nothing fits the bill better than Tacos Mexico.  The tacos are great and not only that, but they're dirt cheap, typically ~$1.00-1.25 apiece, depending on what kind you get.  I'll stop there for breakfast (yes, breakfast - they're open 24/7) and have 6 or 8 tacos.   For about $10 I'm stuffed.

One of the best things about Tacos Mexico is that you can get tacos made with a lot of exotic meats that you don't find at many places.  Instead of just the usual beef/chicken/fish tacos you can also get tripe, cabeza, intestine, tounge meat, etc.   They also make an awesome bowl of menudo (tripe soup) for ~$6.

As many have noted, this place is kind of dumpy but who cares?

I was worried I couldn't find the place, but it was right on the first floor with a huge sign that was widely visible from the outside. 

The entrance has a tiny cubby where you can put your shoes. You hang your coat right on top it and then you're greeted by an overly eager and enthusiastic receptionist.

There's incense burning and you get a general good feeling about the ambience. 

Who said the room is not hot? The guy next to me was dripping sweat by bucket. *metaphor intended* But seriously, that room is like a freaking sauna for those who haven't been to hot yoga before! There were about 30 people in the room and there was almost enough space between the mats. I could not believe how challenging hot yoga could be and that power flow class definitely made me breathe heavily and even stop at some poses so I don't faint.

The instructor was a young girl and she was very precise and helpful in adjusting the beginners. 
The bad part of the experience was the tiny change room and I believe there were only two showers for over 20 women who had just stepped out of the class. They didn't have paper towels, just two regular brown towels.

Would this be my lucky day for ramen?  I was excited to try out this place since I saw the signs go up in this shopping center. We got here on a Friday night and were quoted a 30 minute wait but actually got seated in maybe 10-15 minutes. Seating is a bit limited as the shop itself is small. 

The namesake ""hachi"" or 8 refers to the number of ingredients in a bowl of their ramen. There are currently 4 different types to choose from: Shoyu, tonkatsu, miso, and the hachi special which comes with more chashu pork and egg. Note that getting the miso ramen or combination is an extra dollar versus getting the shoyu or tonkatsu. After browsing through their menu I decided on the miso ramen karaage combination and tried some of the tonkatsu ramen. The combination includes a side of karaage chicken, rice bowl, and a small bowl of bean sprouts in addition to the ramen of your choice. 

When I got my ramen I was disappointed that there weren't any slices of pork in it, despite paying an extra dollar. On the menu too it states that the ramen bowls come with your basic toppings: 1 piece chashu, 1/2 flavored egg, black mushroom (Or corn, bean sprouts), 1 piece dry seaweed, and green onion so I was expecting some kind of meat at least in the bowl. I thought at first a brown clump spotted on my ramen was maybe ground meat but it turned out to be miso paste. The flavor of the broth itself was very light, and the bowl had the thicker, yellow crinkled kind of noodles. Quite honestly I didn't really enjoy the flavor that much and the only thing I liked about the bowl was the lovely 1/2 egg which was marinated in soy sauce with a deep gold colored soft yolk. The tonkatsu ramen I tried did have the piece of chashu pork in it which was flavorful and tender, and it came with the thinner, straight, more pale noodles that look similar to what they serve at Tampopo Ramen. 

The karaage chicken was lightly battered, very juicy and tender. 

If I came here again I wouldn't get the miso ramen again due to the higher cost for value but maybe another variety of ramen from here will be better!",26.0,"DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog","['fun', 'fact', 'hachi', 'means', 'japanese', 'considered', 'lucky', 'number', 'lucky', 'day', 'ramen', 'excited', 'try', 'place', 'saw', 'signs', 'shopping', 'center', 'got', 'friday', 'night', 'quoted', 'minute', 'wait', 'actually', 'got', 'seated', 'maybe', 'minutes', 'seating', 'bit', 'limited', 'shop', 'small', 'namesake', 'hachi', 'refers', 'number', 'ingredients', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'currently', 'different', 'types', 'choose', 'shoyu', 'tonkatsu', 'miso', 'hachi', 'special', 'comes', 'chashu', 'pork', 'egg', 'note', 'getting', 'miso', 'ramen', 'combination', 'extra', 'dollar', 'versus', 'getting', 'shoyu', 'tonkatsu', 'browsing', 'menu', 'decided', 'miso', 'ramen', 'karaage', 'combination', 'tried', 'tonkatsu', 'ramen', 'combination', 'includes', 'karaage', 'chicken', 'rice', 'bowl', 'small', 'bowl', 'bean', 'sprouts', 'addition', 'ramen', 'choice', 'got', 'ramen', 'disappointed', 'weren', 'slices', 'pork', 'despite', 'paying', 'extra', 'dollar', 'menu', 'states', 'ramen', 'bowls', 'come', 'basic', 'toppings', 'piece', 'chashu', 'flavored', 'egg', 'black', 'mushroom', 'corn', 'bean', 'sprouts', 'piece', 'dry', 'seaweed', 'green', 'onion', 'expecting', 'kind', 'meat', 'bowl', 'thought', 'brown', 'clump', 'spotted', 'ramen', 'maybe', 'ground', 'meat', 'turned', 'miso', 'paste', 'flavor', 'broth', 'light', 'bowl', 'thicker', 'yellow', 'crinkled', 'kind', 'noodles', 'honestly', 'enjoy', 'flavor', 'thing', 'liked', 'bowl', 'lovely', 'egg', 'marinated', 'soy', 'sauce', 'deep', 'gold', 'colored', 'soft', 'yolk', 'tonkatsu', 'ramen', 'tried', 'piece', 'chashu', 'pork', 'flavorful', 'tender', 'came', 'thinner', 'straight', 'pale', 'noodles', 'look', 'similar', 'serve', 'tampopo', 'ramen', 'karaage', 'chicken', 'lightly', 'battered', 'juicy', 'tender', 'came', 'wouldn', 'miso', 'ramen', 'higher', 'cost', 'value', 'maybe', 'variety', 'ramen', 'better']","2017-02-07"

I appreciate that it's semi-self serve, because that means I can refill my coffee as much as I want and grab any condiments I want (Cholula! Varieties of Tabasco! Ketchup!), but I think the price-point is a little steep for this type of service. Almost $50 for 4 at breakfast? I dunno. Seemed a little ridiculous.

My omelet had a really tasty combo of roasted veggies, and I loved the way the zingy sun dried tomatoes played off the fresh mozzarella. The roasted rosemary potatoes were tasty enough, although Wildflower's are better in my opinion. Toast was toast. Get your choice of jellies when you go pick up your own silverware and napkins, because you are not a dick and can do it yourself.

The first time I went there, was just for a check up on my new puppy and to get her up to date on all her shots.  I saw Dr. Sabo, she was fine.  At the end of my visit when I went to pay my bill, there were two ladies sitting at the front desk, one who was just with me in the other room, and another lady.  They both ignored me.  I waited for 5 minutes, till I finally said I needed to pay my bill and then they both blamed the other person.  So I went back three weeks later for the one last booster my puppy needed.  First of all, the assistant was very rough with my puppy and made her cry just over getting her temp.  Next I saw Dr. Cohen who tested my puppy for blindness, then spent the next five minutes discrediting spay/neuter clinics and trying to get me to have my puppy spayed with them.  All I wanted was the booster, went to the front desk to pay my bill and they charged me $24 for the exam with the Dr. which I didn't even ask for, could have told them my puppy wasn't blind and didn't need to pay them for advertising to me that they were better than a spay/neuter clinic!  I told the lady all I scheduled was a booster, not an exam.  She responded we are not allowed to give puppies boosters with out an exam by the doctor.  I told her when I scheduled my appointment the lady should have informed my there was going to be an exam.  Then her answer was well you can sign a waiver not to have an exam.  So I said didn't you just say it was mandatory?  So now she tells me she needs to call the Dr.  When she gets off the phone, her answer was no we cannot take off the exam it is mandatory.  They lost my business right there!  And on top of that they had the nerve to give me an estimate of a spay for my puppy with all these random charges, including a micro chip implant which my dog already has and they know that!

So I will never go to them again, and would not recommend them.

For those of you that know me, let's talk parking! You all know parking is super important for so many reasons to me.... mainly safety!! This place is an absolute nightmare. No valet!, The parking lot and surrounding areas to park is not safe at all!!! My rental car actually had its plates stolen the last time I stayed here!!! Dark parking garage, min parking around the building, busses coming in and out where a person should park to check in!!! Nightmare!! That's the kind of place were talking about folks!!  And it has gotten worse from the last time he stayed here about six months ago.
I arrive it's around 10:30 on a Monday night I'm exhausted ... The staff was not friendly.... Two bottles of water here's your floor... Even though I happened to be a very nice level within the Hilton honors membership!... 
I get to my room, BOOM!! Right at the gate, the smell of sewage coming out of the bathroom is almost unbearable! I immediately close the sink drain, the bathroom drain and the one vent in the bathroom! And closed the door!  It did help a little bit. I called the front desk to tell them about the horrid smell and leaking bathtub coming from the bathroom, As you can see below, And they said they would have someone up....I waited literally an hour and 15 minutes, then called - they said they are on lunch and will come up
After,  it's 9:10 PM!!!!! The ""engineer comes up to say... what happened to the toilet.... I seriously thought I was going to pee myself laughing so hard! He drained the tub and then told me.... the leaking has been fixed but I don't smell the smell, I can give you a SPRAY! nothing we can do! He gave me a card that said 24/7!! haaaaaaaaaaaaaa only when your not on BREAK! He left the drain open AND LEAVE THE DRAIN OPEN AND a WIERD PILLOW CASE ON THE TOILET! ( see below! ) Like maybe that is what he used to open the drain!... I did not even see him bring that in with him!! Like maybe he had his pocket? So weird! So weird so weird so weird so weird!! I'm serious folks! I can't make this stuff up!! Ha!!!!!!!!!!!Oh my gray! Ok you get the point, I was super irritated. Moving on! 
There were un matched paint touchups throughout the entire room, big bold anchor nail holes in the wall with off-color dirty marks around the frame... WITHOUT THE FRAME!! Not to mention the disgusting horrible stains on the beautiful bench directly to the left of the TV... At the foot of your bed! ( see below! ) 
The Wi-Fi here is totally a joke! It's very very spotty to say the least have to check in every single day... it drops the signal on the 30 min mark... almost to the dot, They don't have an option for a wifi check in for your entire stay....,just another inconvenience.  
At this point it will never stay at this hotel again... As I said the last time that my plates got stolen! However, as all of you know, I would give them another try for the benefit of the doubt! Bad bad bad decision!
Let's talk about the good for 2.5 seconds, there is a hairdryer in the bathroom there is a bar downstairs... That actually does have pretty decent Pinot Grigio wine,  that in itself! Gave them the second star... I'm just saying, not to mention the bartender here is absolutely amazing super friendly love her love her love her! and it's right off the strip. The air-conditioner and small  refrigerator works really well. I didn't try to TV because I will never ever touch and hotel remote control in my life !!! 
The food is average breakfast hotel food, nothing fresh... But you know what I'm saying. The cups are about the size of a children's Starbucks, so not a grande... But below that. It's the only size they offer... And it's bold regular or decaf. They don't offer sugar in The raw...being super picky at this point, however they do offer half and half regular milk... And the big pump things full of French vanilla and hazelnut creamer, The non-refrigerated kind. I no some people love that, however not my thing.
I never ever get housekeeping, so I really can't comment on that.
There is plenty of space in the drawers, easy to open and the sliding mechanisms are obviously taken care of.And the bed is super comfortable. The duvet however, is a nightmare! There's the scratchy thing on top and a smooth piece on the bottom, however your duvet is always going to touch your face! So you have to pull your sheet way up over your head so that the sheet touches your face and not The scratchy duvet cover! I don't like that!!, I bring my own blanket with me sometimes, thank God this is one of those times.

Lots and lots of family and children here... Again not really my thing.  You be the judge.

I always get my haircut done by Andrea and I love her, she never disappoints. She makes sure to listen to what you want, looks carefully at pictures you give her (if you do), asks you about what kind of styling you do to your hair (blow dry/air dry, curl, straighten, etc), and a lot of more nice stuff. She really listens. If you plan on colouring your hair but aren't sure of what to do yet or have an idea but need a professional's opinion, you can also ask her because she also seems to have knowledge on what would be good for your hair when it comes to colour. 

For colouring though, I go to Damon. I've been to him once, and from that first time, it's safe to say that I will definitely go back to him whenever I will want to colour my hair. I had an appointment with him the day after I got a haircut from Andrea and she told him what I wanted, they pretty much explained to me the same thing of what the results/process of colouring my hair would be (because it's long and thick). Damon did a great job at fixing my already coloured hair (with ugly grown out roots). He was so sweet, making sure I was comfortable. I had a friend with me, so I wasn't bored while waiting for my colour to set and Damon joined in our conversation like we were friends for a long time. A slight problem that I had after getting my hair rinsed was that I had to schedule an appointment for blow drying because it is not provided with the colouring (you have to pay for the blow drying separately). I found it silly, but it was okay. At the end of my appointment, my hair looked great & felt great (still feels great) even after being coloured.

All I have to say is, I would highly recommend going Adikt Salon for a haircut and for colouring. :)",0.0,"1_9XA0nof6TimF9tHYx6DQ","['ve', 'going', 'years', 'ask', 'want', 'water', 'tea', 'coffee', 'getting', 'settled', 'haircut', 'andrea', 'love', 'disappoints', 'makes', 'sure', 'listen', 'want', 'looks', 'carefully', 'pictures', 'asks', 'kind', 'styling', 'hair', 'blow', 'dry', 'air', 'dry', 'curl', 'straighten', 'lot', 'nice', 'stuff', 'listens', 'plan', 'colouring', 'hair', 'aren', 'sure', 'idea', 'need', 'professional', 'opinion', 'ask', 'knowledge', 'good', 'hair', 'comes', 'colour', 'colouring', 'damon', 've', 'time', 'safe', 'definitely', 'want', 'colour', 'hair', 'appointment', 'day', 'got', 'haircut', 'andrea', 'told', 'wanted', 'pretty', 'explained', 'thing', 'results', 'process', 'colouring', 'hair', 'long', 'damon', 'great', 'job', 'fixing', 'coloured', 'hair', 'ugly', 'grown', 'roots', 'sweet', 'making', 'sure', 'comfortable', 'friend', 'wasn', 'bored', 'waiting', 'colour', 'set', 'damon', 'joined', 'conversation', 'like', 'friends', 'long', 'time', 'slight', 'problem', 'getting', 'hair', 'rinsed', 'schedule', 'appointment', 'blow', 'drying', 'provided', 'colouring', 'pay', 'blow', 'drying', 'separately', 'silly', 'okay', 'end', 'appointment', 'hair', 'looked', 'great', 'felt', 'great', 'feels', 'great', 'coloured', 'highly', 'recommend', 'going', 'adikt', 'salon', 'haircut', 'colouring']","2016-01-22"

I'm in vegas on vacation (here for a month)  and this  visit to BJ's was  an  EPIC FAIL!!!  
My party consisted of two, we were seated, I ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious and hot upon arrival, however  my food arrived cold and I told my server 3 times that I have allergies (I carry an Epipen). 
I ordered the turkey burger with NO Avocado, NO Tomatoes and NO Cranberries and my friend ordered  a different burger.  My order came with EXTRA Cranberries, Cold french fries and my friends burger was cold along with Cold french fries as well, When we flagged down the server,  and told him about our order, he offered to take it back to the kitchen but due to fear and bad experiences with the food being returned we declined and LEFT!  
The server didn't offer any type of discount or condolences for our loss of appetite and acted as if his mind was on other things, possibly day dreaming of another job etc.   So a waste of $40 and we ended up going somewhere else for Lunch AGAIN as replacement for the food purchased at BJ's.

First, the line. It's like this place was giving away free Rolex's. They weren't. So waiting 20-25 minutes in line was a bad start. 

Second, the process. They have a bunch of ice cream making stations. The way they do the ice cream, pouring it out fresh, is cool, I'll give them that. But then it's a bunch of chopping and slicing and dicing, picking ingredients, then more slicing and dicing, eventually leading to the ultimate build up of rolling the ice cream and serving. 

Third, the final product. Eh. I mean it's ice cream. I got a traditional mix in of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. My wife got a Ding Dong & chocolate syrup mixed in. It just wasn't that good. Maybe candy isn't what it used to be? The chocolate became super waxy and just stuck to our teeth. You could hardly taste the chocolate syrup that was added. The presentation was nice, but after the second or third bite you're no longer eating ""rolled ice cream"" you're eating a cup of ice cream. 

I'd rather have Thrifty Ice Cream or Baskin Robbins. If I'm in the mood for a mix in, the classic Cold Stone would do the trick.

I told him I didn't think so as the fries were cold and stale and my husband's wrap was cold.  Again, he is arguing with me that everything was made fresh and then told his employees there were only 3 there to get me more french fries and chicken nuggets.  He took the wrap in the back and put it in the microwave.

I never received and I'm sorry just an attitude.  The older woman behind the counter told me she was sorry a couple of times.  I told them all that there was another Wendy's around the corner on Deer Valley and that is where I will be going to from now on.

It took 20 min for our server to come and actually take our order. We asked our server (I think his name is Alejandro; tall, dark hair and olive skinned) to change the channel on the tv but he never did even though he said he would update us. When we asked a second time after we got our food if the manager was okay with it, he stuttered out some excuse about the manager being too busy to change a channel. The restaurant had 6 tables inside. We order the tavern burger, a chicken sandwich, and fish tacos but they were out of fish tacos.

First the Quality. HHI's team of carpenters, drywall and tile guys are great. I think they are hard workers and their quality is spot on. VERY happy with the work they have done. I would love to manage this team myself because I feel that under the proper direction, this would be a great team. We did a master bath remodel (complete gut) and they installed a new (larger) shower including curb, retiled floor, shower/vanity wall and tub surround. Awesome work and it turned out beautiful.

Planning/communication. I should state that I have very high expectations. When you tell me something, I hold you to it.  I think HHI is a good company to hire if you don't have deadlines and don't mind micro-managing every step.  The first project manager I was given (yes, I had two), was completely unresponsive. Didn't answer texts or calls. In fact, I have cameras installed in my home and I called him while he was there. He looked at his phone and put it back in his pocket.  In HHI's defense, they let him go so I'll give them that, but before they did, he admitted the company was horrible at communication. 

We specified that we wanted 1/8"" grout on the floor and 3/8"" on the walls.  We got 1/8"" on floor and walls because no one told the tile guys actually doing the work. We didn't bother pushing because it looked ok so we let it go. 

We clearly spelled out that we wanted a 36"" shower door. They built the shower curb in such a way that two pieces of glass were needed and a smaller door was required. This was unacceptable because we specifically called out a single piece door. The salesman openly admitted to making the error on the design, but because I didn't catch it, I had to pay an extra $120 to fix their mistake. When I asked the project manager about it, his response was ""It was built per the design"". Buyer beware. Review your design VERY carefully. If you sign it, it's your fault, no matter how badly they screw up.  

Specifically asked that the shower head be raised 3 inches.  When the plumber showed up, no one had told him. Luckily, I was there at the time and made sure he knew to do it. 

HHI has a very cool online tool with schedules, places for notes, pictures, etc.  Don't bother. They don't read the notes. After making two requests on the notes, neither was read so I left a third note asking if anyone actually reads the notes and to call me immediately. No call. No one reads the notes.  

Last item, the shower glass. This is the last item on the project. I was told that they now do their own shower glass (I was going to go with someone else, originally). They quoted a comparable price and a faster turn-around of roughly 5 biz days.  Glass was measured on Nov. 1st. On the 10th I got a text from the new Project manager telling me the glass was on backorder. They didn't even know about this until it didn't show up on the truck the day it was due. Although not directly their fault, customers don't care about a supplier's sub-supplier. If you commit, you own it. Don't push the blame to the sub-supplier.  Backordered part was finally done and was due in Phoenix Friday morning (11/17) from CA. On Thursday 11/16, I received a text message from the new project manager with a picture attached. The picture was of a pile of shattered tempered glass. No explanation, no message. I didn't want to play ""guess what this is"" so I called. They told me that the supplier was loading it on the truck and one of the pieces shattered. Now they are rushing to get the glass complete and installed before Thanksgiving. I have guests coming from out of town and don't want 7 of us sharing one small bathroom. I could go on, but won't. This is sufficient. 

Bottom line, the quality of the work (once it's done) is beautiful. The guys in the trenches to great work. If I were rating them on Quality/Workmanship alone, I would have given them a 4 or even a 5.
If you are retired or have lots of time to oversee their work and manage the project for them, I would say go for it. BUT... If you are a working couple like my wife and I, plan on weeks of frustration as you try to get answers to questions. Much of the end result was due to us watching on camera or coming home and inspecting every night and then calling/texting to make sure things were done as planned.

I believe their shortcoming is due to a lack of communication/mgmt. and I believe this is a tops-down issue. Much of my texts and conversations were with Brandon (one of the owners) who was very quick to blame his sub-supplier (for the glass) and say there's nothing they can do. As I said before, customers don't care. As a manager of suppliers, I understand the difficulty he deals with. But I also know that you have to hold your sub-suppliers accountable and MAKE them commit. Drive them to fix problems. Not just say ""there's nothing I can do"".",15.0,"46do3FnqVA5eCVuQSpbIBw","['begin', 'going', 'break', 'pieces', 'quality', 'planning', 'communication', 'quality', 'hhi', 'team', 'carpenters', 'drywall', 'tile', 'guys', 'great', 'think', 'hard', 'workers', 'quality', 'spot', 'happy', 'work', 'love', 'manage', 'team', 'feel', 'proper', 'direction', 'great', 'team', 'master', 'bath', 'remodel', 'complete', 'gut', 'installed', 'new', 'larger', 'shower', 'including', 'curb', 'retiled', 'floor', 'shower', 'vanity', 'wall', 'tub', 'surround', 'awesome', 'work', 'turned', 'beautiful', 'planning', 'communication', 'state', 'high', 'expectations', 'tell', 'hold', 'think', 'hhi', 'good', 'company', 'hire', 'deadlines', 'mind', 'micro', 'managing', 'step', 'project', 'manager', 'given', 'yes', 'completely', 'unresponsive', 'answer', 'texts', 'calls', 'fact', 'cameras', 'installed', 'home', 'called', 'looked', 'phone', 'pocket', 'hhi', 'defense', 'let', 'll', 'admitted', 'company', 'horrible', 'communication', 'specified', 'wanted', 'grout', 'floor', 'walls', 'got', 'floor', 'walls', 'told', 'tile', 'guys', 'actually', 'work', 'bother', 'pushing', 'looked', 'ok', 'let', 'clearly', 'spelled', 'wanted', 'shower', 'door', 'built', 'shower', 'curb', 'way', 'pieces', 'glass', 'needed', 'smaller', 'door', 'required', 'unacceptable', 'specifically', 'called', 'single', 'piece', 'door', 'salesman', 'openly', 'admitted', 'making', 'error', 'design', 'catch', 'pay', 'extra', 'fix', 'mistake', 'asked', 'project', 'manager', 'response', 'built', 'design', 'buyer', 'beware', 'review', 'design', 'carefully', 'sign', 'fault', 'matter', 'badly', 'screw', 'specifically', 'asked', 'shower', 'head', 'raised', 'inches', 'plumber', 'showed', 'told', 'luckily', 'time', 'sure', 'knew', 'hhi', 'cool', 'online', 'tool', 'schedules', 'places', 'notes', 'pictures', 'bother', 'read', 'notes', 'making', 'requests', 'notes', 'read', 'left', 'note', 'asking', 'actually', 'reads', 'notes', 'immediately', 'reads', 'notes', 'item', 'shower', 'glass', 'item', 'project', 'told', 'shower', 'glass', 'going', 'originally', 'quoted', 'comparable', 'price', 'faster', 'turn', 'roughly', 'biz', 'days', 'glass', 'measured', 'nov', 'st', 'th', 'got', 'text', 'new', 'project', 'manager', 'telling', 'glass', 'backorder', 'know', 'truck', 'day', 'directly', 'fault', 'customers', 'care', 'supplier', 'sub', 'supplier', 'commit', 'push', 'blame', 'sub', 'supplier', 'backordered', 'finally', 'phoenix', 'friday', 'morning', 'ca', 'thursday', 'received', 'text', 'message', 'new', 'project', 'manager', 'picture', 'attached', 'picture', 'pile', 'shattered', 'tempered', 'glass', 'explanation', 'message', 'want', 'play', 'guess', 'called', 'told', 'supplier', 'loading', 'truck', 'pieces', 'shattered', 'rushing', 'glass', 'complete', 'installed', 'thanksgiving', 'guests', 'coming', 'town', 'want', 'sharing', 'small', 'bathroom', 'won', 'sufficient', 'line', 'quality', 'work', 'beautiful', 'guys', 'trenches', 'great', 'work', 'rating', 'quality', 'workmanship', 'given', 'retired', 'lots', 'time', 'oversee', 'work', 'manage', 'project', 'working', 'couple', 'like', 'wife', 'plan', 'weeks', 'frustration', 'try', 'answers', 'questions', 'end', 'result', 'watching', 'camera', 'coming', 'home', 'inspecting', 'night', 'calling', 'texting', 'sure', 'things', 'planned', 'believe', 'shortcoming', 'lack', 'communication', 'mgmt', 'believe', 'tops', 'issue', 'texts', 'conversations', 'brandon', 'owners', 'quick', 'blame', 'sub', 'supplier', 'glass', 'said', 'customers', 'care', 'manager', 'suppliers', 'understand', 'difficulty', 'deals', 'know', 'hold', 'sub', 'suppliers', 'accountable', 'commit', 'drive', 'fix', 'problems']","2017-12-01"

My wife ordered the pan seared trout. The trout was obviously previously frozen, overdone, and with an exterior of greasy flour.

The nurses diligently controlled the pain meds down to the minute to make sure there was no unnecessary hardship, food services even went out of their way to make sure food was available to myself and my wife during the most dire of times, use of scanners to find and set an IV on the first try is brilliant, nurses were knowledgeable about the situation and compassionately provided the highest quality of care even at the end of their extremely long shifts. You even walked me to my car after being discharged and continued to care for my recovery until the moment I was in the car. Some hospitals may provide one or two of those qualities, but only Western Reserve Hospital provides all of them. These are just a few of the reasons why I will always come to you in the future when my family needs medical help of any magnitude. Please take these comments seriously. My family has spent more time than most in hospitals in Akron and Cleveland over the past four years and none of them offer the quality of medical services you provide.

This place is N-I-C-E! From the lobby to the change room to the weight room.  

You don't really appreciate a clean and sufficient change room until you have been into a dirty and cramped one.  The change change room had a little lounge area with a tv and couches, hair drying stations, and a steam room (a little tight though).

The training area is really modern so you don't feel like you're in a prison with weights.  Machines and equipments were sufficient and well spaced.  I went on a Saturday morning so the place didn't feel crowded.  Maybe if it was weeknights then I can imagine this place being packed like a sardine can.

I give this gym a 4 star based on a FREE workout and what it is as a gym.  I have no clue what the cost is.  My only complain is that they treat guest like ATM machines and very eager to withdrawal cash from you; they held onto my driving license in front of me until a salesperson came over even after I had asked if I can have my license back.

It's July 5th, and many places are closed, including my gym.  Off to Red Rock this morning hiking.  I parked in the lot where the horse trailers park at the exit from the Scenic Drive.  The hike starts from just inside the exit gate by the parking lot.

The trail was made by horse riders.  It heads toward the Potato Knoll, also known as Wilson's Pimple, the high mound at the base of Mount Wilson.  The trail goes across two dry creek beds, past some petrified wood, and around the back of the Knoll.  When you get to the back of the Knoll, you can take a side trail to the top of the Knoll and get a great view.

Follow the trail around the base of the Knoll and you can't get lost.  It's always good to have a GPS unit with you, and always bring plenty of water when you hike.  It's a desert out there, you know!

An alternative way of doing this hike would be to park at the Oak Creek parking area along SR 159 and hike back to the Knoll along the Oak Creek trail.  Circle the base of the Knoll and then head back.  

The hike is about 5 miles and it took me 2 hours.  There is an elevation gain of only about 150 feet.  It's very gentle.

The photos I have posted are the ones I took today.  If you have any questions about the hike, send me a message.

A google search for ""best pizza & wings in Scottsdale"" lead me to TJ's Pizza & Wings. I'm a NYC pizza fan and that's what the reviews praised here. 

My son and I got there and ordered with the intention of eating our 16"" large pizza and 24 wings (for $23.95) there but after sitting down and feeling how slippery the floor was, we decided to get it to go. The slippery (greasy?) floor freaked us out a little, plus there was a good college football game we were missing on a much bigger TV at home.

The guys at the counter were very friendly, wait time was minimal and we picked up drinks at Circle K next door. Another nice convenience was the Redbox machine right outside TJ's front door.

Pizza didn't look as good as I expected it to look after reading all the great reviews but my first bite removed that hint of doubt I had. Great thin crust, cheesy, foldable and a little greasy... Just the way I love it! The other reviews I read about the wings had me pretty anxious to try them out too.  I'm a deep fried crispy wing fanatic and that's exactly how they cooked them. Even after the 5 minute ride home, they were still crispy and drenched in hot sauce, like they should be. Each wing was meaty and decent sized, not like the miniatures I got at Buffalo Wild Wings last weekend (and I love that place).   I would have given TJ's 5 stars if the slices were bigger (large is 16"" and as big as they make) and the slippery floor in the dining area didn't freak us out so much! I will definitely be going back for take out. Another nice incentive is that you can save the cutout coupons on the pizza box for a free 16"" pizza for every 15 coupons.

It is located in a great location (which also means that if there are events going on at the ACC that you might end up paying $25 for parking! Ouch.)  My word of advice?  Look for the Green P at 10 York Street (which doesn't look like it will be there very long as it looks like a condo development is going up in its place).  We were lucky enough to have nabbed the last spot and paid $4 for parking.

Tucked away in the corner of the Telus Tower you will find the entrance to Aria.  It has a very Manhattan feel to it with high ceilings, big glass windows that faces the Maple Leaf Square and trendy seating.  The chairs are quite comfortable, and the Damask sofa seats are chic!

I made a reservation online and the only time available was later in the evening.  I was rather upset when I showed up to the restaurant and there were quite a few empty tables.  I like to eat dinner earlier, rather than later.

A complimentary coat check is available though the hostess was less than stellar. She left us unattended for a few minutes before reappearing.  However, another server (who I later found out is the pioneer behind the Cocktail Menu) aided us.

We were seated in the corner with a great view of Maple Leaf Square.  The service here is very lax and this is definitely a place you could spend hours at without being hustled out the door.  

After having perused the cocktail menu I decided on La Motta, which is a vodka-based drink with fresh yuzu, peach simple syrup and rosemary.  To my surprise, my cocktail was salty?  I don't think I was so hungry that my taste buds went awry, but my DC also concluded that my drink was salty.  When prompted about how our cocktails were I mentioned I didn't like it, and the Ryan Gosling look-a-like cocktail pioneer said he'd whip me up another cocktail personally.  This time I opted for the Dahlia.  While I did say I wanted something sweeter, this was TOO sweet.  It was like drinking a minty maple syrup.  The presentation of the cocktails were pretty, but suffice it to say that I nursed my sweet cocktail like a child forced to drink carrot juice.  The Sazerac that my DC ordered was definitely a man's drink as it was S-T-R-O-N-G (Rye whiskey-based drink).  My word of advice, order a wine instead.  They have an impressive display of wines that go from floor to ceiling (and that is one HIGH ceiling).  

A trio of bread was brought out.  A French, an Italian and a Focaccia.   The Focaccia was by far my favourite as it was crusty on the top, but spongy throughout.  It was a Rosemary bread, and was very good with the spreadable butter.

For starters we ordered the Carne Cruda served with a raw egg, black truffle and Porcini fries.  This knocked my socks off.  This is what a steak tartare should be like.  Tender, just the right amount of salt, and just the right amount of pickled tang.  It didn't even need pepper.  The raw egg added a luxurious, creamy texture to the dish.  And the fries, although there were only 5 of them, were divine.

For mains we opted for the Bigoli alla Bottarga which was a thick noodle served with garlic, chillies, roasted tomatoes, herbs and Bottarga di Muggine which is a cured roe of grey mullets.  The thick noodles were a very firm pasta.  I just kept chewing and chewing and chewing at it.  The tomatoes were pleasantly sweet, but I didn't care too much for the bitter aftertaste of the Bottarga.  

The Deboned Partridge served atop a bed of Fregola Sarda, porcini bread stuffing, bay leaf essence, chestnuts and fig puree.  Fregola Sarda is a type of Sardinian pasta that loosely resembles Israeli Couscous but has the texture of a Spaetzle.  It was very savoury and complemented the crisp-skinned deboned partridge very well.  I don't know that I would've chosen partridge as it is a much more muscular bird, which means a tougher meat.  

For dessert we were disappointed to learn that the Napolean and Chocolate Eclairs were sold out for the night, so we opted for the Buddino.  In hindsight, I probably should've taken the sold-out options as a cue that they were the best in the house and opted out of dessert.  Oh well.  The Buddino was served with a Mascarpone cheese.  It was quite the unconventional ""pudding"" as it was more like a flourless chocolate cake encased with a tart pastry.  The chocolate flavour was quite weak as it but lingered for a mere second in your mouth before disappearing altogether and if there was any chestnut, it was lost.  The tart shell was chewy.  I think this dish is lost somewhere between a flourless chocolate cake and a brownie.  

Verdict:

And even after the very small gesture they gave, providing us with one complimentary cocktail each, the drink bill showed up on my final statement and had to go to the front desk at 6am before we left for the airport to clear up the charge, which took about a half hour. Thanks, but no thanks. 

I thought about giving it just one star, but the property is beautiful (everything looks identical from when it was Loews) so that's worth one more star.

We came here when they first opened up and fell in love with it ever since.  Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.  

Most sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.  

Let me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this ""Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce""? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.  

Now for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.  

Side dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.

I literally could not work out because every treadmill is BROKEN (for weeeeks now). I finally found a treadmill that was working and I almost fell off because it was shaking SO much. Fine, whatever. I went to the ellipticals instead, and after three minutes the machine, on its own, went from level 1 to 25 in three seconds! So I once again went to the front desk to complain and let them know about it. I'm sure they know me by now. 

I figured I would try to work out using some of the equipment in the women's dungeon. Hot as balls, terrible green lighting, more broken machines, and the lady next to me smelled like an ashtray. 

Maybe you would like to use the weight machines instead? Great, well good luck trying to find a machine with pins in it. That is also a very common issue at this gym. Perhaps you would like to do your own work out in the fitness room when classes aren't going on, well, too bad because they lock it up so you're left to stretch in the tiny area right outside the fitness room, or.. back to the dungeon instead. 

Want to sanitize your hands? Sure, there is NEVER any sanitizer actually IN the container on the wall. 

Why I like this gym? It's close to my house. The staff is also nice, but nice doesn't give me a workout. I get more frustrated AT the gym than anything else. Not good.

Waited 45 minutes In line just to check in. They said Sunday was their busiest day, so wondering why they were not prepared? Others behind me waited over an hour just to get to the desk.

Going into the room the view and decor was great. But not pleased at all by the sandwich we found by the mini bar rotting and made the room smell. 

We went for dinner at the buffet which was wonderful. I love seafood and desserts which this place is great! 

Later signed up for a red card for the casino. Our card did not work. They told me to following instructions on the slot machine when using the card. I thought that was rude as I know it didnt work. Finally after an hour of going back and fourth lining up at the red card counter they went with me to realize that on their side of the computer it was active but not a working card.  They apologized for the inconvenience.

In the evening after a long day the tv,which worked earlier did not. There was a blue screen that would not turn off and no cable. Got someone to fix it the next day as it was an it was so late but was uncomfortable with the light. 

The next day we went to the pool was great and relaxing. Got back from the hotel to take a shower to realize that there was no shampoo/conditioner or soap!! They cleaned our washroom and forgot to replace our toiletries. Had to get out of the shower to call housekeeping!!  Again they apologized.

As we only stayed here based on reviews on yelp and tripadvisior. So would like others to see my review based on our stay.

Their stores are sparkling clean and bright, with white as the predominant color and highlights of fun neon green and fuschia. The minimalist decor keeps the feel modern. I think they usually have about 4-5 machines with two flavors of frozen yogurt each (plus a swirl option), so a decent amount of flavors to choose from. The fro-yo is good... I don't usually get it just on its own but I can imagine it would be good if you did. For me it's all about the toppings - their topping selections are awesome - a variety of fresh fruits, nuts, sprinkles, cereal, gummies, chocolate chips, crumbled candy bars, graham cracker, cake bites... you name it. The spoons are a good size and the containers are easy to get in and out of.

Oh, and the sauces!! This location had hot fudge, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow sauce, and caramel. They're in the ""fountain"" type machines instead of store bought bottles (like some of the other places I've gone to) 

The employees are very nice - they've been trained on the Menchie's ""kool aid"" and we've been wished a ""smiley day"" each time we've visited. 

The format is the usual fro-yo place format - grab a cup (""bucket"" may be a more accurate term) - I actually like getting the waffle cone or waffle divider options out of the little plastic case on the countertop. Then you choose your flavor(s), get the amount of frozen yogurt you'd like, and add your toppings. Once you've got your fro yo all set, they weigh it to determine the price, you pay, and you're golden. 

The prices are good - mine is usually under $4 (and sometimes under $3), which, when compared with the cost of ice cream treats at other places (Cold Stone, Frost) at $5 or $7 each, it feels like a steal!

Ordered Pad Thai with chicken
Coconut soup with Pineapple
and mango salad for take out.

Ate the Pad Thai for lunch. Good. Average. Lots of chicken but nothing special. Some of the noodles were all clumped/glued together. Not sure why.

Waited to have the mango salad and soup for dinner.

Mango salad. WTF? There was something seriously wrong with this. I have NEVER EVER had mango salad like this before.  It tasted at least 2 weeks old and some of the mangos were BAD. Like brown bad! Plus, something (or two somethings) was very sour. Like prickle your tongue bad OJ sour. The 'dressing' appeared to be orange juice-like in nature (?) and there was about 2/3 of a cup of it in the container.
I couldn't tell if it was just the mangos or the drsg or both, but whatever it was after 2 bites I threw the whole thing out. That says a lot about how bad it was. I don't usually complain about my food but this was one of the rare exceptions. This was so disappointing because mango salad is one of my favourite things and I was really looking forward to enjoying it.
But no!

This made me very leery about the coconut soup. But I proceeded anyway. I ordered it with pineapple because I love pineapple and I've never had it that way before and thought I'd try it as i usually just have it with chicken. Given the state of the mangos, I was relieved to see that they used canned pineapple chunks in the soup and not fresh. I thought this would at least decrease the risk of them being bad. The soup was just ok. Not much chicken (if any) in it. The pineapple was less than exciting but I would not order this again. There was nothing really wrong with it other than the lack of chicken but it just didn't work for me. Another disappointment.

Finally, menu prices and what I was actually charged were different.
Online menu: http://www.greenmango.ca/assets/green-mango-bloor-menu-2014.pdf

Pad Thai: price $11.95 (charged: $12.95)
Coconut Soup with chicken + pineapple: price: $6.95
Mango salad: price $7.95 (charged: $8.95) - way too expensive IMO!
I have a real problem with actual prices being different than posted prices. That's just intentional deceit and intolerable business practices as far as I'm concerned.

So would I recommend this place: No! 
Would I go back: No! 
Reason: If a restaurant doesn't take the time to check the quality of their ingredients or worse, doesn't care, then I am not inclined to go back. There are no do-overs in the food industry. There are lots of businesses competing for my money - why not do it right the first time?
Secondly, if I can't trust the quality of the food or accurate pricing on the menu, I'm done.

Also, drove by the restaurant twice because the signage was so poor on the outside. Looked for trademark green logo/design but it was actually some weathered old paintless wood (nothing green) and when I finally saw it, thought it had been derelict and shut down. So that wasn't good either.

Restaurants, an online menu makes sense when it's updated! 

Odd door-front curtains. It's a cool entrance but corny from inside.. is it to separate crammed dining room from those waiting? It sticks out, and Bar Marco is more a dim-lit+high chatter+blend-in vibe. Dark with a stifling dash of hipster.

Service was slammed, one guy working the 8 tables out front. Our second round of drinks took 25 minutes. He apologized before we could comment when he dropped the check, so they're good enough to realize it. Descriptions were on-point 75%, occasional stuttering and stammering when questioned. 

The bar is novelty. ""We have no cocktail menu"" she challenged with a smirk. Game on! Drink #1 was awesome, ordered in person. Drink #2 was third-person via waiter, and it came out with 2/5 the ingredients asked for. Conclusion: SIT AT THE 6-PERSON BAR, WHOLE MEAL. That said, neither drink was more standout than a good cocktail from a printed-menu.. anticipate that novelty wearing thin on return trips.

Food is decent at best, mix of tapas and classy bar. Cheese plate is a cheese plate, the earthy honey and jalapeno jelly the highlight. The fried smelt needs more lime and salt, the fish arguably too delicate for frying though the light mayo cuts the oil well. The tartare is well-diced with few clumps but way over-spiced, cumin masking the meal. The bolognese was bland and the sauce watery with chemical hints. Definitely could do with more salt and another minute on the noodles.

If the bar is one reason I'd return, the pork belly is the other. Everyone does pork belly these days. Bar Marco actually does it right: perfectly crisp edge with the piping hot sticky gob of fat melting in your mouth. No ""sour"" per the menu, but the definite highlight.

Two gripes:  
The hotel staff was not very attentive.  Several time during my stay, I needed to speak with the concierge, but I wasn't able to find anyone manning the desk.  Also, the hotel is in a very less-than-reputable area of town, and by that I mean fully nude strip clubs.

My husband and I came here on a weekday night for dinner. Both of us had a late lunch at work that day, and weren't very hungry, so we ordered our usual - the Kawartha Combo. The Kawartha combo comes with a Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. Usually, we would order another item as well, however on nights when we are not that hungry, this combo alone is just the right amount of food. But boy were we disappointed when the rolls were placed on our table. They were so much smaller than what we had gotten in the past! 

In the past, every time we've come here for dinner, we get complimentary miso soup and salad. However, this time, we were not given these. I just assumed that maybe the waitress forgot, so I asked her about it.  And she told me that because the combo I ordered was too cheap, it would not include the soup and salad. I mentioned that in the past, this was not the case, and she told me that this had always been the rule. I hate it when restaurants I've been a loyal customer to lie to me and pretend that I'm the one that doesn't know what I'm talking about. Usually upon getting the bill, the restaurant would also provide complimentary ice cream, but of course, this was not provided this time as well. Also, if the combo we ordered was considered too cheap for both of us, we should have at least gotten one set of miso soup, salad and ice cream, since it definitely should have been more than enough for one person.

We received 3 quotes and despite some differences (3 sides of the house vs 4), this one was reasonable at $580 to cut back 4 large pines (that were about 40 ft high), 2 palms and 6 mid size trees as well as some bushes on 3 sides of the house. Most of the trees are not on our property, but hang over.

The only criticism I have is that I didn't receive a call the day before or day off confirming the appointment, so I had to call after waiting a couple of hours in the morning and received a window of 11am-1230pm. The crew of 4 showed up at 11am.

It was shocking how to quickly they worked, shooting up those pines, cleaning and chipping.

Very satisfied customers and happy those branches are gone.",0.0,"UgbD11PPoJID7w6vRxxuHw","['stars', 'experience', 'neighbors', 'giant', 'pines', 'branches', 'hanging', 'pool', 'dropping', 'needles', 'cones', 'received', 'quotes', 'despite', 'differences', 'sides', 'house', 'vs', 'reasonable', 'cut', 'large', 'pines', 'ft', 'high', 'palms', 'mid', 'size', 'trees', 'bushes', 'sides', 'house', 'trees', 'property', 'hang', 'criticism', 'receive', 'day', 'day', 'confirming', 'appointment', 'waiting', 'couple', 'hours', 'morning', 'received', 'window', 'pm', 'crew', 'showed', 'shocking', 'quickly', 'worked', 'shooting', 'pines', 'cleaning', 'chipping', 'satisfied', 'customers', 'happy', 'branches', 'gone']","2016-09-11"

A slightly upscale-ish look to it.  The menu is fairly extensive so if you can't find something here to eat, well then you have issues!  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  I've tried this at Harlem restaurant so I was curious how PB would stack up.  I loved their waffles - they have jalapenos in their batter which gives the waffles a nice kick to them.  They are light and fluffy and all things that waffles should be.  They could give you one more waffles since the fried chicken to waffle ratio could use some tweaking.  I prefer the friend chicken at Harlem though.  At PB, while the inside of the chicken is surprisingly moist, the outside is a bit too charred for my liking.  It doesn't remind me a of the typical fried chicken.  

The service is good, but since we came at lunch time it wasn't particularly busy so I would expect it to be good.  We were here last year as well, and one order was slighly screwed up (we pre-order to have more time to eat and relax).  They fixed it immediately by bringing the correct side right away.  So that was nice - no arguing,no extra cost (although I wouldn't expect there to be, but sometimes you never know)

You'd be better off finding a motel on the side of a highway! I'm not one to say these types of things without some sort of proof so I'll just list the things that happened during my two night stay at this hotel: 1. Our alarm went off for faulty reasons at 230AM and they did not give us any discount or even an apology! 2. Half the hotel is blocked off and shut off to save them money, so it was really weird and poor to see, usually when you go to a hotel you like to experience the hotel, especially when the part blocked off and closed was the bottom floor when you first walk in. 3. The included breakfast they offer is a waste of time! If you didn't get there in the early morning you got nothing! When we went for ours on Saturday morning the only things left was a few bagels,muffins and cereal... no milk, no spoons, no coffee, no fruit, no yogurt, nothing was replenished throughout the morning! 4. They're hair dryer didn't work and they didn't have a spare to replace it with (and I was getting ready to go to a wedding) 5. The rooms were not well cleaned at all! There was still dust everywhere which makes me question the quality of everything else cleaned... 6. The service there is the most poor service I've ever encountered the man at the front desk was so extremely rude! And I would understand his rudeness if I were being rude but I was completely polite while dealing with him! Unacceptable. 7. And to top it off this hotel wasn't cheap, so it's not like you should deal with these issues for the price you pay!

The restaurant is located in a strip mall but the food certainly doesn't reflect it.  The interior is nicely decorated and painted in nice soft earth tones.  The lighting is low but bright enough to see what you need to.

The waitress greeted us and we looked over the wine list.  The bottle prices are very reasonable but we ended up just having a couple glasses of a nice Super Tuscan.  

The waitress brought a nice hearty Italian loaf and olive oil with a little balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Very tasty.

We chose risotto and lobster balls and calamari as appetizers.  The risotto balls were nicely crisp on the outside and quite tasty.  There were five of them and they were large so be aware.  

The calamari was good and came with a dipping sauce and lemon wedges.  Very tasty.

We split a Greek style salad which was fresh and crisp.

My wife had the pasta bolognese and I had the grilled shrimp skewers with risotto.  Both were excellent and the portions were large enough that we both had lunch the next day.

We were so stuffed that we took a dessert to go.  It was a layered chocolate mousse cake and was very, very good...even at 11pm!

Overall we were extremely pleased with the food, service and atmosphere.  We'll be back to D'angelo's soon for another meal.  I think I'll try the ravioli next time.

The only type of ramen I eat is Tonkotsu broth based. This place now ranks right under my #1 ramen spot which is tied between the Ajisen Ramen chain (because of the Ajisen Special ramen with spice bow) and Tampopo Ramen in Tempe, AZ.

First of all, they make their noodles in-house just like at Tampopo, and have one of the limited number of noodle making machines in the USA as well, I have only seen 3, Tampopo in Tempe AZ, Underground Ramen in SF, and this one, so it's always exciting. As expected, the noodles were top notch, and the broth was only below the best by the slightest of margins.

The thing that put this place at 5 stars for me was the fried pork belly that I ordered with my side of fried rice, O.M.G!!! That was soooooo good.  I requested that it's be crispy and it did not disappoint. Order fried rice with a  side of crispy pork belly when you go.

The first floor basically is just about the same since it opened. There is a section now on impact of music from Cleveland/Akron Area and Ohio. The Black Keys were definitely a focus of this section, since they're doing so well and from Akron. They even had Afghan Whigs featured in the Cincinnati area. I saw them many a times at Bogarts in Cincinnati.
The third floor has video about the history of MTV and they have not touched the video, me and a friend watched it twice, if you're a child of the MTV generation as I am you will enjoy it, but you can see how dated it is, but also MTV has changed and doesn't play music videos anymore.
Fifth and Six floors has a special Grateful Dead exhibit.
They did have the 2012 inductees and a few items from the new inductees on display.
They also had some new items on display, which were from a few artists I don't think are hall of fame worthy, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Skillrex, The Decemberists or is it to just add some items from some newer musicians to attract younger attendees?

We were super hungry, so we ordered several dishes for variety. The portion sizes are decent to share. 

KIMCHI PANCAKE Rated 3/5 - It isn't consistent. Our first visit it was very balanced, flavorful, loaded up with vegetables and seafood. Our second visit it was too doughy, almost raw with no color and lacked vegetables and seafood. I hope that was just a one-time deal, but I am worried to find out. 

KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN Rated 4/5 - I love the super crispy and flavorful batter. We enjoyed it. 

SPICY COLD KIMCHI NOODLES Rated 4/5 - The noodles and broth are all simple, but addictive. I love slurping up the cold tangy noodles and crunchy kimchi, seaweed and cucumbers. The crushed ice swimming in the broth makes this dish the perfect fix on a hot summer day. Also pairs really well with salty and spicy food! 
 
KALBI RIBS & KIMCHI FRIED RICE Rated 2.5/5 - The bone-in kalbi ribs are on the fattier side, but tender. Unfortunately the kimchi fried rice was too oily for my liking. I will skip this dish next time.

Although not everything I tasted is 5/5, I still think about this place when I'm in the mood for a comforting Korean meal that transports me to a friend's kitchen.

Still being a Vegas newbie I have been finding a lot of places word of mouth.  This is the classic example of that.  Cue scene: Me singing and another venue and making new friends.  We realize that getting on stage again isn't going to happen, and inevitably, someone will say, ""Ellis"".  With nods, grins, and everyone quietly repeating ""Eliis"" in approval, I decided to follow everyone over there.

I loved how small the entire place was.  What I loved even more was the pricing of the beer-- $1.75.  The first time I was there I got the stout.  It was alright.  I'm very stout picky and prefer the imperial variety, but it wasn't bad.  The next time I got the IPA.  I haven't moved on.  It's the one for me.  If you ask for water, it's a bottle for $1.  One night they hassled me about a minimum to use  my card, and every other night it's been fine... so be aware of that.

The books are huge.  They have ones by song title and ones by artist.  There are also many other songs that aren't in the books, so you can always ask.  Also, everyone is pretty friendly.  You can always strike up a convo with people visiting or the regulars.  My only issue is the queue.  Most nights I have gone tended to be from 30 minutes to 90 minutes to sing.  A lot of times  I've seen people get up 5-6 times while others have gotten up 2 times even though they have songs in... and it's not like the it was a quality of singing issue.  It actually upset some of the patrons so badly that they started complaining to me about it (like I could do anything) then the host.  Maybe the 5-6 time people were big tippers?  Maybe people were getting irritable because they had been there since 10 drinking and it was almost 3?  I'm not entirely sure.  Maybe I'm too easy going to care.

With all that said, it really is one of the best venues for karaoke.

I've frequented a variety of antique / second-hand stores in the past few years and found much of the inventory to be overpriced compared to what I've seen in stores and/or online for the same kinds of items. I do think that it has some great deals to be had, but the sheer size of the place could overwhelm even the most seasoned antiquer, making it difficult (and arguably not worth it) to wade through everything it has to offer just to find a couple gems.

It's obviously quite popular, and so my guess is that lot owners pay a premium to showcase their items here...which they oh-so-graciously pass on to us, the consumers. I'd love to find a more out-of-the-way, less popular antique store that hasn't jacked up its prices, despite the fact that the Sleep Poet is so conveniently located to me.
